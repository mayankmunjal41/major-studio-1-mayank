Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, Pittsburgh;[7] gift 1937 to NGA.





[1] On this collection see Frank Herrmann, _The English as Collector. A Documentary Chrestomathy_, London, 1972: 320-326, and Oliver Bradbury and Nicholas Penny, ""The picture collecting of Lord Northwick: Part I and Part II,"" _Burlington Magazine_ (August and October 2002): 485-496 and 606-617. The fact that Gustav Friedrich Waagen, _Treasures of Art in Great Britain_, 3 vols., London, 1854: 3:195-212, does not mention the painting in describing his visit to Thirlestane House does not mean that it was not there; in fact the eminent connoisseur could not make notes, as he himself informs us, of more than 200 of the some 800 pictures seen during his short stay.



[2] Fern Rusk Shapley, _Catalogue of the Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, D.C., 1979: 1:222.



[3] _Catalogue of Pictures at Stansted Hall_, 1872: 8, as by Gentili [sic] da Fabriano. The painting is already cited by Joseph Archer Crowe and Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle, _A New History of Painting in Italy, from the II to the XVI Century_, 3 vols., London, 1864-1866: 3(1866):80 n. 6) as owned by Maitland. Not included in the sale of the collection on 10 May 1879 at Christie, Manson & Woods, London, it remained with the collector's son and heir.



[4] The painting is listed in the 1893 _Catalogue of Pictures at Stansted Hall_ as number 17, by Gentili da Fabriano. See also Max J. Friedlander, _Die Sammlung Dr. Eduard Simon_, Berlin, 1929:  22, no. 3, and Denys Sutton, ""Robert Langton Davis. Part 2,"" _Apollo_ 109, no.  207 (May 1979): 373; according to Friedlander the painting was acquired by Douglas from ""Stanstead [sic] House."" See also letter from Douglas to Fowles dated 1 May 1941, Duveen Brothers Records, Box 244 (reel 299).



[5] The painting is described in the catalogue of the Berlin _Ausstellung_ (1914, no. 123) as being in the Simon collection, on which see Barbara Paul, ""Das Kollektionieren ist die edelste aller Leidenschaften,"" _Kritische Berichte_ 21, no. 3 (1993): 51-53. The acquisition was probably a fairly recent one.  Edward Hutton (in Joseph Archer Crowe and Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle, _A New History of Painting in Italy..._, 3rd ed., ed Edward Hutton, 3 vols, London and New York, 1908-1909: 3:126 n. 8) was unaware of it and erroneously identified the ex-Maitland _Adoration_ as the one that during his time belonged to the collection of Richard von Kaufmann in Berlin (today in the Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller in Otterlo). Tancred Borenius (in Joseph Archer Crowe and Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle, _A New History of Painting in Italy..._, 2nd ed., ed. Langton Douglas and Tancred Borenius, 6 vols., London, 1903-1914: 5(1914):176 n. 6) also did not know the whereabouts of the painting.

[1] Lichtenthal as the source is first mentioned by Mary Batterman Booth in a letter to John Walker, undated but with material from late 1942, in NGA curatorial files.  On that Cistercian convent in Baden-Baden, see Emil Lacroix et al., _Die Kunstdenkmäler der Stadt Baden-Baden_ (Karlsruhe, 1942), 406-522; Sr. M.

Sister Schindele, archivist of Lichtenthal, who provided these references, reported that the church and convent were supplied with works of art beginning in the late fifteenth century by two noble abbesses, Margaretha von Baden [1477-1496] and Maria von Baden [1496-1519], and that financial difficulties forced the sale of some works of art around the beginning of this century (letter to Alison Luchs, 26 February 1986, in NGA curatorial files).

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

[1] On this collector, see Francis Haskell, _Rediscoveries in art: some aspects of taste, fashion, and collecting in England and France_, Ithaca, 1976: 72.



[2] Burton Fredericksen (in _The Index of paintings sold in the British Isles during the nineteenth century_, 4 vols. Santa Barbara, 1988: 1:49, 295) established the painting's ownership, which is not specified in the sale catalogue, on the basis of an annotated copy of the catalogue in the files of Christie's in London.



[3] See Michael Compton, ""William Roscoe and Early Collectors of Italian Primitives,"" _Liverpool Bulletin_ 9 (1960-1961): 47. Hugh Macandrew (letter of 11 September 1961 to William Campbell, in NGA curatorial files) transcribes a description of the painting in Roscoe's hand from a manuscript catalogue of his collection (Roscoe Papers, Liverpool Library, 3897).



[4] Everett Fahy (his letter of 19 November 1984 in NGA curatorial files) called attention to a Cooper negative of the painting in the Frick Art Reference Library in New York; the photograph, taken on the occasion of the sale in 1924 in London, shows the painting dirty and with a check running vertically through the figure, but otherwise with an aspect not unlike the present one.



[5] According to Evelyn Sandberg-Vavalà, ""Francesco Benaglio,"" _Art in America_ 21 (1933): 62-63.



[6] By April 1948 (the date of Roberto Longhi's expertise, copy in NGA curatorial files), the panel must already have been with Contini Bonacossi, for whom Longhi wrote his opinion in Italian (his expertises for the Kress Foundation are usually in English).



[7] The Kress Foundation made an offer to Contini Bonacossi on 7 June 1948 for a group of twenty-eight paintings, including the Benaglio; the offer was accepted on 11 July 1948 (see copies of correspondence in NGA curatorial files, see also The Kress Collection Digital Archive, https://kress.nga.gov/Detail/objects/1832).

[1] In his _Elogio del pittore Gentile da Fabriano_ (Macerata, 1829: 21-23), Amico Ricci describes an _Adoration of the Magi_ at that time in possession of a certain Captain Craglietto of Venice, attributing it to Gentile da Fabriano. That work subsequently became part of the collections of the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin (no. 5), where Crowe and Cavalcaselle saw it and assigned it to Antonio Vivarini (Sir Joseph Archer Crowe, and Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle, _A New History of Painting in Italy, from the Second to the Sixteenth Century_, 3 vols., London, 1864-1866: 3[1866]:99). Gaetano Milanesi, who is his edition of Vasari's _Lives_ (Vasari, ed. Milanesi, 1878: 3:21) limits himself to reporting Ricci's attribution, in the catalogue of the Toscanelli collection expresses the doubt that the painting later in Berlin was the same as the Craglietto _Adoration_, and implies that the panel described by Ricci was actually the one in the Toscanelli collection.  Although the Berlin catalogues point out that their _Adoration_ was acquired directly from the heirs of Gaspare Craglietto, the erroneous provenance suggested by Milanesi for the ex-Toscanelli panel was picked up by Salomon Reinach (_Répertoire de Peintures de Moyen Age et de la Renaissance_, 6 vols., Paris, 1905-1923: 1[905]:72), and subsequently by Fern Rusk Shapley (_Catalogue of the Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, D.C., 1979: 1:64). It is possible that the painting was acquired only after 1878, as at this time Milanesi apparently did not yet know it.

[1] René Ménard, ""Spinello Aretino,"" _Gazette des Beaux-Arts_ 9 (February 1874): 118, 119, includes an engraving identical in every detail to the Gallery's painting and writes that the painting ""Provient de la cathédral de Sienne, où elle était encore sous la Restauration"" (""comes from the cathedral of Sienna, where it was still under the Restoration""). When the panel entered or left the cathedral, or under what circumstances, is unknown. It is unlikely that the cathedral would have been its original location, given the painting's private devotional function.



[2] According to the Demidoff sale catalogue, where the 1874 engraving reappears, Barker acquired the painting from one of the oldest patrician families in Tuscany.



[3] The name of the consigner to the 1889 sale was kindly provided by Jeremy Rex-Parkes, Christie's Archives, London. The buyer is given in a newspaper article added to the Knoedler microfiche copy of the 1889 sale catalogue.



[4] Early Widener collection records (in NGA curatorial files) indicate that the painting was acquired from Nardus in 1898 but do not mention prior provenance. An article in an April-June 1902 readers' forum in _Les Arts_ invited discussion of the quality and attribution of a painting in an unnamed collection visually indistinguishable from NGA 1942.9.50. One Paris respondent noted that the Widener [NGA] painting was identical to the one reproduced, but it is reasonable to assume that the painting reproduced in _Les Arts_ was actually the Widener painting. Berenson then connected the Barker painting to the one in the Widener collection in his 1916 Widener collection catalogue.

[1] The painting was confiscated by the Nazis in July 1940 from the collection of André Seligmann and taken to the Germany Embassy in Paris (See _Verzeichnis der im Juli 1940 durch die Geheime Feldpolizei in Paris gesicherten und in die Deutsche Botschaft uberbrechten Gegenstände aus judischen Kunsthandlungen_, p. 8-9, National Archives RG260/Ardelia Hall Collection/Box 469/File VII and ERR card no.

The records of the Munich Central Collecting Point indicate that the painting was recovered in Berchtesgaden and restituted to France on 30 October 1946 (see Munich property card #6772/1722 as Flemish c. 1480, National Archives RG260/Box 503, and French Receipt for Cultural Objects No. 14A, item no. 121, National Archives RG260/Box 287, copies NGA curatorial files). In 1951 the Office des Biens Privés deposited the painting at the Musée du Louvre in Paris (M.N.R. number 622).

[1] In his _Elogio del pittore Gentile da Fabriano_ (Macerata, 1829: 21-23), Amico Ricci describes an _Adoration of the Magi_ at that time in possession of a certain Captain Craglietto of Venice, attributing it to Gentile da Fabriano. That work subsequently became part of the collections of the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin (no. 5), where Crowe and Cavalcaselle saw it and assigned it to Antonio Vivarini (Sir Joseph Archer Crowe, and Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle, _A New History of Painting in Italy, from the Second to the Sixteenth Century_, 3 vols., London, 1864-1866: 3[1866]:99). Gaetano Milanesi, who is his edition of Vasari's _Lives_ (Vasari, ed. Milanesi, 1878: 3:21) limits himself to reporting Ricci's attribution, in the catalogue of the Toscanelli collection expresses the doubt that the painting later in Berlin was the same as the Craglietto _Adoration_, and implies that the panel described by Ricci was actually the one in the Toscanelli collection.  Although the Berlin catalogues point out that their _Adoration_ was acquired directly from the heirs of Gaspare Craglietto, the erroneous provenance suggested by Milanesi for the ex-Toscanelli panel was picked up by Salomon Reinach (_Répertoire de Peintures de Moyen Age et de la Renaissance_, 6 vols., Paris, 1905-1923: 1[905]:72), and subsequently by Fern Rusk Shapley (_Catalogue of the Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, D.C., 1979: 1:64). It is possible that the painting was acquired only after 1878, as at this time Milanesi apparently did not yet know it.

[5] According to Colin Simpson, _Artful Partners: Bernard Berenson and Joseph Duveen_, New York, 1986: 196-198, the painting was acquired by Hamilton from Duveen's Paris stock in 1919-1920.  Edward Fowles (_Memories of the Duveen Brothers_, London, 1976: 127-129) discusses Hamilton and the large collection of Italian paintings that Duveen offered to him on approval.  However, Hamilton did not purchase them and returned them to Duveen the following year.

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

[1] The precise basis for the tradition that the picture comes from the Basque province of Guipuzcoa has not been found. In a statement in the NGA curatorial files, Robert Quinn analyzed the history and holdings of various monastic establishments in the province, concluding that the most likely candidates for ownership of the _Adoration_ were the Convento de Bidaurrete and the Convento de Aránzazu, both in Oñate; see also Colin Eisler, _Paintings from the Samuel H. Kress Collection: European Schools Excluding Italian_, Oxford, 1977: 65-66.



[2] See note 4; Max Friedlander, in a letter of 21 March 1937 to Kress commenting on a photograph of the painting, says ""I have seen the original many years ago in London."" This information and note 4 have been added to the provenance after the 1986 publication of the NGA systematic catalogue of Netherlandish paintings.

[1] Ugo Bardini was the son of the dealer Stefano Bardini, Florence (1836-1922); it is possible that the painting had been owned by the father. The painting is listed in Agnew's stock book, no. 6494, as ""Mantegna, St. Jerome,"" no dimensions, with seller and purchaser (reference provided by the Getty Provenance Index). Alfred M. Frankfurter, ""Paintings by Andrea Mantegna in America,"" _The Antiquarian_ 13, no. 4 (November 1929): 88, states that the painting ""came to America from a moderately well known English collection.""



[2] Kahn is identified as the owner in the following: Lionello Venturi, ""Un opera inedita di Andrea Mantegna,"" _L'Arte_ 30 (1927): 32; Alfred M. Frankfurter, ""Paintings by Andrea Mantegna in America,"" _Antiquarian_ 13, no. 4 (November 1929): 33; Lionello Venturi, _Pitture italiane in America_, Milan, 1931: 9, and English ed., New York, 1933: 31; Bernard Berenson, _Italian Pictures of the Renaissance_, Oxford, 1932: 328, and Italian ed., Milan, 1936: 291); Roberto Longhi, ""Risarcimento di un Mantegna,"" _Pan_ II, no. 3 (March 1934): 512; Hans Tietze, _Meisterwerke europäischer Malerei in Amerika_, Vienna, 1935: 327, and English ed., 1939: 311. The Duveen prospectus states that the painting, then said to be by Mantegna, was ""discovered in an English private collection in 1927, when it was acquired by...Kahn...in whose collection it remained until 1936"" (copy in NGA curatorial files). However, letters in the Duveen Brothers Records indicate the painting was not purchased from the Mogmar Art Foundation until 14 April 1937, and that payment was made to the Foundation on April 28, just after Duveen Brothers sold the painting to the Mellon Trust (copies in NGA curatorial files; Box 473, Folder 1, Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, The Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles).

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

[1] Into one of the vertical members of the painting's cradle a piece of wood with two identical seals is inset. This was obviously from the back of the panel before it was thinned. The seals are decorated with the Austrian imperial eagle and bear a fragmentary inscription of which the words ""per l'esportazione"" can be read. This type of seal was used by the exportation office of the Accademia di Brera in Milan on the paintings to be exported during the time of Francis I of Austria (1792-1835).  Similar seals are visible on the back of a number of early Italian panel paintings; among others are Piero della Francesca's _St. John the Evangelist_ in the Frick Collection in New York and the _Saint Augustine_ by the same artist in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga in Lisbon (see Andrea Di Lorenzo, ""Il politico agostiniano di Piero della Francesca: Dispersione, collezionismo, restauri, recostruzione,"" _Il Polittico Agostiniano di Piero della Francesca. Quaderni di Studi e Restauri del Museo Poldo Pezzoli 2_, Milan, 1996: 17, 39 notes 32-34 and 52, repro. 105). According to Di Lorenzo (letter of 26 April 2000), the Accademia probably stopped using the seal in 1848, when Ferdinand I of Austria, successor of Francis I (who used the same symbol) abdicated.  In any case, the seal was not used after 1859-1860, when Austrian dominion in Milan ended.



[2] See Bernard Berenson's letter dated 26 June 1915, to Arthur L. Nicholson (copy in NGA curatorial files), in which the painting is mentioned.



[3] The painting was shown at the _Old Masters' Exhibition_ at the Arthur U. Newton Galleries in October 1936 and mentioned in the exhibition reviews published in the _New York Times_ (7 and 11 October) and in the _New York American_ (17 October) of the same year.  The fact that Berenson did not list the painting in his _Italian Pictures of the Renaissance_, Oxford, 1932, suggests that by 1932 it was already on the art market.

[1] The buyer's name at the Blayds sale appears in an annotated copy of the sale catalogue in the Getty Library, Los Angeles (copy in NGA curatorial files). 

[2] According to Oscar Eisenmann, _Ausgewählte Hanzeichmungen alterer Meilsler aus de Sammlung Edward Habich au Cassel_, Lübeck, 1890: n.p., preface, Habich built up his collection in 1880s. At the time of the 1892 sale of his collection (see _Katalog der ausgewählten und reichhaltigen Gemäldesammlung des Reutners herrn Edward Habich zu Cassel_, sale catalogue, Haberle, Cologne, 9-10 May 1892), the NGA painting was apparently not yet in his possession.

[3] The date of the donation is given in _Katalog der Kniglichen Gemäldegalerie au Cassel_, Antiliche Ausgade Berlin, 1913: 63. Girolamo Mancini, _Luca Signorelli_, Florence, 1903, is the first to cite the painting as belonging to the Kassel Gallery.

[4] Miklós Boskovits, author of the NGA systematic catalogue entry on the painting, could not find any record of the sale, which probably occurred in the years of Germany's economic and political crisis just after World War I.

[6] See _Catalogue des Nouvelles Acquisitions de la Collection Goudstikker_, a catalogue for an exhibition shown in Amsterdam and Rotterdam November 1930 and January 1931 (no. 39 in the series of catalogues published by the dealer Jacques Goudstikker). The NGA painting is no. 2585 in Goudstikker's personal record of the works of art he acquired, his so-called ""Black Book,"" which indicates the dealer owned a half share of the painting with Dr. Hans Wenland (original in the Archive of Jacques Goudstikker and Desi Goudstikker-Halban, Amsterdam City Archives; copy in NGA curatorial files). The Goudstikker firm and most of its contents were sold in July 1940 to Alois Miedl, an agent of Hermann Goering, to whom Miedl subsequently sold some of the inventory. However, the July 1940 contract for the sale of the firm specifically noted that any works of art in which third parties held interest were not included in the sale (see C.I.R. #2 - The Goering Collection, 1945; Consolidated Interrogation Reports, 1945; Records of the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas, 1942-1946 [RG 239]; National Archives and Records Administration, Washington; RG239/Entry73/Box 80; copy in NGA curatorial files). The Goudstikker firm continued to operate throughout World War II under Miedl's direction.  According to documents in the Dutch State Archives, the NGA painting was not sold to Goering. It was discovered in one of Miedl's buildings in the Netherlands after the war and returned to Goudstikker's widow, Desirée Goudstikker von Saher, on 18 May 1949 (Dutch State Archives ARA, NBI 857, nr. 7, copy in NGA curatorial files; see also letter dated 24 March 1999 from the Inspectie Cultuurbezit of the Netherlands, in NGA curatorial files.)

[1] The provenance from the church of Santa Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi in Florence, first published in the Kann Collection catalogue in 1907, is confirmed by both documents and stylistic evidence.  A record of February 1503 in the archive from that church in the Archivio di Stato, Florence, indicates that a priest called Ser Giovanni di Domenico ""de vreti"" (""of the stained glass windows"") was due payment for ""two windows made in the choir with figures"" (Luchs, Alison, ""Origins of the Widener Annunciation Windows,"" _Studies in the History of Art_ 7 [1975]: especially 89, doc. 5; Florence, Archivio di Stato Compagnie Religiose Soppresse, C.XVIII 502, no. 357, fol. 205.)  It indicates Giovanni was to be paid at the same time for a window for the Riccialbani chapel in the church. The Riccialbani window, still in situ and bearing a simple coat of arms of that family in a roundel, has borders whose fruit-cluster and floral designs perfectly match those of the National Gallery windows. See Luchs 1977, 28-30, on the choir chapel, which was altered beyond recognition in 1628, and Luchs 1975 for the removal of the windows and their reinstallation in a new chapter house between 1628 and 1630. The date and circumstances of their removal from this location are unknown. Since the windows next appeared in a French collection, they may have been removed during Napoleon's Italian campaign, when several altarpieces from the church were taken to France. See Everett P. Fahy, Jr., ""Les cadres d'origine de retables florentins du Louvre,"" _Revue du Louvre_ 26, no. 1 (1976): 6-14. 

[2] Kann catalogue 1907, 1:15, no. 22. 

[3] In a letter of 1 March 1916 to Joseph Widener, Joseph Duveen writes that Duveen Brothers ""possess only a two-thirds share"" in this window and NGA 1942.9.311; the dealer having the other third appears to have been Wildenstein's (Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles: Series II.I.

[1] The provenance given here is based on George Henry McCall, _The Joseph Widener collection. Tapestries at Lynnewood hall, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania_, Philadelphia, 1932: 47, and expanded by the research of Dr. Candace Adelson. 

      Roger-Armand Weigert, ""L'âge d'or de la tapisserie flamande et les collections de Mazarin,"" in _De Bloeitijd van de vlaamse tapijtkunst, Internationaal Colloquium, 23-25 mei 1961_, Brussels, 1969: 423-424, disagreed with the traditional provenance from Cardinal Mazarin, stating that the tapestry did not appear in either of the Mazarin inventories, made in 1653 and 1661.  However, Gertrude Townsend, then curator of textiles at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, pointed out to John Walker in letters of 21 and 27 January 1943 (in NGA curatorial files), that the tapestry did correspond with no. 1735 of the 1661 inventory, despite a slight difference in dimensions, an argument also accepted by Jean-Paul Asselberghs, _Les tapisseries flamandes aux Etats-Unis d'Amérique_, Brussels, 1974:  43-44. The 1661 description (""Post-mortem inventory of Cardinal Mazarin, May 1661, Bibliothèque, Paris, _Mélanges de Colbert_, 75: fol. 449r; published in Gabriel-Jules, comte de Gosnac, _Les Richesses du Palais Mazarin_, 2nd ed., Paris, 1885: 400, no. 1735) reads: ""1735.  Une autre pièce de tapisserie, fabrique d'Angleterre, de laine et soie relevée d'or, très riche, représentant _Dieu le Père dans un trône_, quatre anges à ses costez, et quantité d'histoires du Vieil et Nouveau Testament, avecq sa petite bordure parsemée de pierreries fines relevées d'or, haulte de deux aulnes trois quarts et large de trois aulnes et demye ou environ, prisée à la somme de six cent cinquante livres, cy -- 650 L. [livres] T."" 

      Sophie Schneebalg-Perelman, ""Un nouveau regard sur les origines et le développement de la tapisserie bruxelloise du XIVe siècle à la pré-Renaissance,"" in _Tapisseries bruxelloises_, 1976: 183, suggests that some of the English attributions in 17th-century French inventories reflect provenance, and it is known  Mazarin acquired many pieces in his collection from England. His agent followed the sales of Charles I's collection from 1649 to 1653, but none of the king's listed tapestries can be matched to the NGA piece; for instance, the two pieces of _Christ Sitting in Judgment_ were too large (about 35 square meters each). A Charles I provenance cannot entirely be ruled out, however; many descriptions are of sets, or are imprecise, for instance the expensive _Divers Storys_ at Whitehall (L. 22, no dimensions); see W.G. Thomson, _A History of Tapestry From the Earliest Times until the Present Day_, London, 1906: 361, no. 3; 389, no. 968.

      The NGA tapestry is also identifiable in Mazarin's earlier 1653 inventory by its dimensions and type of border (""Inventory of Cardinal Mazarin's effects, 12 September 1653,"" in Jean-Baptiste Colbert, _Inventaire de tous les meubles du Cardinal Mazarin Dressé en 1653_, London, 1861: 146): ""Une autre pièce de tapisserie de laine et soie, fabriquee d'Angleterre, représentant diverses histoires du Vieux Testament en trois arcades, les figures moindres que le naturel, et une bordure fort estroite, parsemée de perles et pierreries, haute de deux aunes deux tiers et demi, large de trois aunes et demie moins un pouce.""

[2] McCall 1932: 47, gave the date as 1824.

[3] McCall 1932, 47, attributes the return of the tapestry to Les Aygalades to Jules de Castellane's better-known nephew, Esprit-Victor-Boniface. The château belonged, however, to Jules, a noted amateur. See Esprit-Victor-Elisabeth-Boniface de Castellane, _Journal du Maréchal de Castellane 1804-1862_, 5 vols., Paris, 1895-1897: 2:314-315; 5:217, and M. Prevost and Roman d'Amat, _Dictionnaire de Biographie française_, Paris, 1951-: a.v. Castellane, no. 23.

[4] Gustave Migeon, _Les Arts du tissu_, Paris, 1909: 238, says Morgan bought the tapestry from a certain Chabrière, whom Hermann Schmitz (_Bildteppiche: Geschicte der Gobellinwirkerei_, Berlin, 1919: 206), infers to be the Lyon collector Chabrières-d'Arles. It might also have been the Castellane heir(s), or representative. Edward Fowles, _Memories of Duveen Brothers_, London, 1976: 21, says the tapestry was offered in 1901 from the south of France to Duveen, who resold it to Morgan.

[5] The high price paid for the tapestry, first by French & Co. and shortly thereafter by Widener, made newspaper headlines; see _The New York Times_ (21 April 1916): 9, and _New York Tribune_ (30 April 1916): n.p., repro.

[1] The Widener collection records in NGA curatorial files note only Duveen Brothers as a previous owner. However, a chair that was once recorded as in the possession of Bardini may have been the NGA chair or its twin. William M. Odom (_A History of Italian Furniture from the Fourteenth to the Early Nineteenth Centuries_, Garden City, New York, 1918: 43-44, fig. 31) writes that the Bardini chair may have come from a Villa Machiavelli, which is not further identified. The Museo Bardini in Florence has a dantesca almost identical to the NGA chair and the one published by Odom (see Alvar Gonzalez-Palacios, ed., _Antiquariato, Enciclopedia delle arti decorative_, Milan, 1981: 2:443).

[1] The Widener collection records in NGA curatorial files note only Duveen Brothers as a previous owner. However, a chair that was once recorded as in the possession of Bardini may have been the NGA chair or its twin. William M. Odom (_A History of Italian Furniture from the Fourteenth to the Early Nineteenth Centuries_, Garden City, New York, 1918: 43-44, fig. 31) writes that the Bardini chair may have come from a Villa Machiavelli, which is not further identified. The Museo Bardini in Florence has a dantesca almost identical to the NGA chair and the one published by Odom (see Alvar Gonzalez-Palacios, ed., _Antiquariato, Enciclopedia delle arti decorative_, Milan, 1981: 2:443).

[1] The Widener collection records in NGA curatorial files note only Duveen Brothers as a previous owner. However, a chair that was once recorded as in the possession of Bardini may have been the NGA chair or its twin. William M. Odom (_A History of Italian Furniture from the Fourteenth to the Early Nineteenth Centuries_, Garden City, New York, 1918: 43-44, fig. 31) writes that the Bardini chair may have come from a Villa Machiavelli, which is not further identified. The Museo Bardini in Florence has a dantesca almost identical to the NGA chair and the one published by Odom (see Alvar Gonzalez-Palacios, ed., _Antiquariato, Enciclopedia delle arti decorative_, Milan, 1981: 2:443).

[1] The provenance given here is based on George Henry McCall, _The Joseph Widener collection. Tapestries at Lynnewood hall, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania_, Philadelphia, 1932: 47, and expanded by the research of Dr. Candace Adelson. 

      Roger-Armand Weigert, ""L'âge d'or de la tapisserie flamande et les collections de Mazarin,"" in _De Bloeitijd van de vlaamse tapijtkunst, Internationaal Colloquium, 23-25 mei 1961_, Brussels, 1969: 423-424, disagreed with the traditional provenance from Cardinal Mazarin, stating that the tapestry did not appear in either of the Mazarin inventories, made in 1653 and 1661.  However, Gertrude Townsend, then curator of textiles at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, pointed out to John Walker in letters of 21 and 27 January 1943 (in NGA curatorial files), that the tapestry did correspond with no. 1735 of the 1661 inventory, despite a slight difference in dimensions, an argument also accepted by Jean-Paul Asselberghs, _Les tapisseries flamandes aux Etats-Unis d'Amérique_, Brussels, 1974:  43-44. The 1661 description (""Post-mortem inventory of Cardinal Mazarin, May 1661, Bibliothèque, Paris, _Mélanges de Colbert_, 75: fol. 449r; published in Gabriel-Jules, comte de Gosnac, _Les Richesses du Palais Mazarin_, 2nd ed., Paris, 1885: 400, no. 1735) reads: ""1735.  Une autre pièce de tapisserie, fabrique d'Angleterre, de laine et soie relevée d'or, très riche, représentant _Dieu le Père dans un trône_, quatre anges à ses costez, et quantité d'histoires du Vieil et Nouveau Testament, avecq sa petite bordure parsemée de pierreries fines relevées d'or, haulte de deux aulnes trois quarts et large de trois aulnes et demye ou environ, prisée à la somme de six cent cinquante livres, cy -- 650 L. [livres] T."" 

      Sophie Schneebalg-Perelman, ""Un nouveau regard sur les origines et le développement de la tapisserie bruxelloise du XIVe siècle à la pré-Renaissance,"" in _Tapisseries bruxelloises_, 1976: 183, suggests that some of the English attributions in 17th-century French inventories reflect provenance, and it is known  Mazarin acquired many pieces in his collection from England. His agent followed the sales of Charles I's collection from 1649 to 1653, but none of the king's listed tapestries can be matched to the NGA piece; for instance, the two pieces of _Christ Sitting in Judgment_ were too large (about 35 square meters each). A Charles I provenance cannot entirely be ruled out, however; many descriptions are of sets, or are imprecise, for instance the expensive _Divers Storys_ at Whitehall (L. 22, no dimensions); see W.G. Thomson, _A History of Tapestry From the Earliest Times until the Present Day_, London, 1906: 361, no. 3; 389, no. 968.

      The NGA tapestry is also identifiable in Mazarin's earlier 1653 inventory by its dimensions and type of border (""Inventory of Cardinal Mazarin's effects, 12 September 1653,"" in Jean-Baptiste Colbert, _Inventaire de tous les meubles du Cardinal Mazarin Dressé en 1653_, London, 1861: 146): ""Une autre pièce de tapisserie de laine et soie, fabriquee d'Angleterre, représentant diverses histoires du Vieux Testament en trois arcades, les figures moindres que le naturel, et une bordure fort estroite, parsemée de perles et pierreries, haute de deux aunes deux tiers et demi, large de trois aunes et demie moins un pouce.""

[2] McCall 1932: 47, gave the date as 1824.

[3] McCall 1932, 47, attributes the return of the tapestry to Les Aygalades to Jules de Castellane's better-known nephew, Esprit-Victor-Boniface. The château belonged, however, to Jules, a noted amateur. See Esprit-Victor-Elisabeth-Boniface de Castellane, _Journal du Maréchal de Castellane 1804-1862_, 5 vols., Paris, 1895-1897: 2:314-315; 5:217, and M. Prevost and Roman d'Amat, _Dictionnaire de Biographie française_, Paris, 1951-: a.v. Castellane, no. 23.

[4] Gustave Migeon, _Les Arts du tissu_, Paris, 1909: 238, says Morgan bought the tapestry from a certain Chabrière, whom Hermann Schmitz (_Bildteppiche: Geschicte der Gobellinwirkerei_, Berlin, 1919: 206), infers to be the Lyon collector Chabrières-d'Arles. It might also have been the Castellane heir(s), or representative. Edward Fowles, _Memories of Duveen Brothers_, London, 1976: 21, says the tapestry was offered in 1901 from the south of France to Duveen, who resold it to Morgan.

[5] The high price paid for the tapestry, first by French & Co. and shortly thereafter by Widener, made newspaper headlines; see _The New York Times_ (21 April 1916): 9, and _New York Tribune_ (30 April 1916): n.p., repro.

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929.

It has been suggested that a gold-woven, four-piece set of the _Passion_, imported to England in 1528 by the Hanseatic merchant Smytting to offer to Wolsey or the king, may be one and the same as the Alba _Passion_, of which NGA 1942.9.447 and 1942.9.448 are two pieces. Smytting describes the set in his correspondence as ""the storye of Christe's mawndye,"" ""the praying of hym in the gardeyn,"" ""Jehsus bering the crosse,"" and ""the hanging of our lorde on the crosse."" A set of tapestry panels depicting ""the riche historye of the passion"" and each measuring 27 square ells was recorded as having been at the Tower of London in the 1547 inventory of Henry VIII's possessions.

[2] A description of four _Passion_ panels whose measurements match those of the Smytting set appears on a list of items shipped by Cárdenas to Spain before August 1654 on behalf of Haro.

[3] Haro also acquired Henry's set of the _Acts of the Apostles_, which he left to the House of El Carpio in his will of 1658.

[4] If the _Passion_ set continued to follow the same route as the _Acts_, they both passed to the House of Alba at some point between 1661 and 1839, probably when the two houses merged in 1733.  This would explain the appearance of the _Passion_ set in the 1877 Alba sale.

[1] This provenance is the result of a collaborative research effort by Peter Humfrey and Burton Fredericksen, who kindly shared their work with the Gallery. When the painting was on the art market in the 1990s, and initially in the Gallery's records, it was identified with one formerly in the collections of the Empress Josephine at Malmaison, of her son Eugène de Beauharnais, and then of his heirs, the Dukes of Leuchtenberg, in Munich and St Petersburg. Supporting evidence was provided by the fact that the engraving of this picture by J. N. Muxel included in the luxurious 1851 catalogue of the Leuchtenberg collection compiled by J. D. Passavant, shows a composition that is near-identical (J.N. Muxel and J.D.  Passavant, _Galerie Leuchtenberg. Gemälde-Sammlung seiner kaiserl. hoheit des Herzogs von Leuchtenberg in München_, 2 vols., Frankfurt am Main, 1851: 8, no. 35, repro.).  However, the Leuchtenberg picture was recorded as still in St. Petersburg by Harck in 1896 (""Notizien über italienische Bilder in Petersburger Sammlungen,"" _Repertorium für Kunstwissenschaft_ 19 [1896]: 413-438; _Die Russischen Bestimmungen über Nachtmärsche und Nachtgefechte: Uebersetzt von Harck_, Leipzig, 1896: 423) and by Néoustroieff in 1903 (A. Néoustroieff, ""I Quadri Italliani nella collezione del Duca G.N. von Leuchtenberg dit Pietroburgo,"" _Arte_, Anno VI, November/December 1903: 329-346, repro. 333), whereas the Gallery's picture had been sold at the Poniatowski sale in Paris in 1867. Indeed, while the photograph of the Leuchtenberg picture reproduced by Néoustroieff corresponds to Muxel's engraving, both show minor but distinct differences from the Washington picture, as is particularly evident in the treatment of the haloes. Furthermore, it was Harck's opinion that the Leuchtenberg picture -- unlike other works by Garofalo in the same collection -- was no more than a copy. This judgement cannot be definitely confirmed until the real Leuchtenberg picture re-emerges, and can be compared with the Gallery's picture. Suspicions that the now missing Leuchtenberg picture was a copy of the Gallery's picture were also raised by Alain Pougetoux (_La collection de peintures de l'impératrice Joséphine_, Paris, 2003: 148), and by Burton Fredericksen in an annotation to the Getty Provenance Index. Another circumstantial argument for suspecting that the two pictures are not identical is the fact that the Gallery's version retains its original wooden support, whereas in nineteenth-century Russia panel paintings were transferred to canvas almost as a matter of routine.

Instead, the Gallery's painting is likely to correspond to one described in the posthumous inventory of Cardinal Ludovisi of 1633 as follows: ""Un Christo che lava li Piedi alli Apostoli quadro alto pmi due lono pmi tre cornice nera rabescata d'oro di mano del Garofano"" (Klára Garas, ""The Ludovisi Collection of Pictures in 1633,"" _The Burlington Magazine_ [1967]: 343, no. 37). The stated dimensions (= 44.68 x 67.02 centimeters) are slightly larger than those of the Gallery's painting, but the measurement in palms is clearly not precise, and as pointed out by Garas 1967, 289 n. 2, it probably included the orginal black frame. The same picture is listed (but with no attribution) in an earlier inventory of the cardinal's collection of 1623, and in the posthumous inventory of 1665 of his brother and heir Niccolò, Prince of Piombino (Carolyn H. Wood, ""The Ludovisi collection of paintings in 1623,"" _The Burlington Magazine_ 134 [1992]: 521, no. 218). Cardinal Lodovisi was a Bolognese, and his collection was rich in pictures acquired directly from Ferrara.

[2] An old label on the reverse of the painting records this part of the provenance: ""Reçu de Monsieur L. Lebeuf de Mongermont [sic] la somme / de neuf mille francs pour payment d'un tableau / peint par Garofalo représentant le lavement des / pieds des apôtres, dont quittance Paris le 21 Mai 1870 / Provenant de la vente du Prince Poniastowski [sic] -- F.

[1] For a detailed study of the Fountaine collection of maiolica see Andrew Moore, ""The Fountaine Collection of Maiolica,"" _The Burlington Magazine_ 130, no. 1023 (June 1988): 435-447. Sir Andrew Fountaine (1676-1753) was the originator of the collection.As Moore writes, no record of individual items in the collection dating from Fountaine's time is known, but eighteenth century texts and Narford Hall inventories describing the collection in general terms do exist, and it is likely that Fountaine acquired much of the collection during his second Grand Tour that began in 1714. Sir Andrew's heirs added items to the collection, and it appears that it was the Andrew Fountaine who lived 1808-1873 (Moore describes him as Andrew IV) who added most substantially to the core of his ancestor's original collection. 

       At the time of Andrew IV's 1835 inheritance from his father (also Andrew Fountaine, 1770-1835), he prepared an inventory of the maiolica that Moore publishes in the first appendix of his article. Between 1855 and his death in 1873, Andrew IV compiled a second inventory, which is contained in the ""Family Book,"" held at Narford Hall at the time of Moore's article. The numbering of this inventory corresponds to numbers which, together with the monogram AF, were incised at some time in the nineteenth century on items in the collection. Moore's article includes a concordance of the numbered items in  the second inventory with the numbered lots in the 1884 sale, and the NGA plate, which has ""af 55"" inscribed on its reverse, is identified as number 55 in part I of the second inventory (this part, of six, is described as ""Small Plates less than 12 1/2 inches in diameter Total 131"").

      The second inventory also includes the initials ""AF"" in the margin next to 99 of the total of 276 maiolica entries. Moore concludes that ""these initials are almost certainly [Andrew IV's] record of his own purchases"" and that ""by inference, the remaining items [with three exceptions]...stand the greatest chance of having been acquired by Sir Andrew Fountaine, the collection's originator, in the eighteenth century. Since the NGA plate entry does not have an ""AF"" next to it in the margin, it is probably one of the items acquired by Sir Andrew.

[1] For a detailed study of the Fountaine collection of maiolica see Andrew Moore, ""The Fountaine Collection of Maiolica,"" _The Burlington Magazine_ 130, no. 1023 (June 1988): 435-447. Sir Andrew Fountaine (1676-1753) was the originator of the collection. As Moore writes, no record of individual items in the collection dating from Fountaine's time is known, but eighteenth century texts and Narford Hall inventories describing the collection in general terms do exist, and it is likely that Fountaine acquired much of the collection during his second Grand Tour that began in 1714. Sir Andrew's heirs added items to the collection, and it appears that it was the Andrew Fountaine who lived 1808-1873 (Moore describes him as Andrew IV) who added most substantially to the core of his ancestor's original collection. 

       At the time of Andrew IV's 1835 inheritance from his father (also Andrew Fountaine, 1770-1835), he prepared an inventory of the maiolica that Moore publishes in the first appendix of his article. Between 1855 and his death in 1873, Andrew IV compiled a second inventory, which is contained in the ""Family Book,"" held at Narford Hall at the time of Moore's article. The numbering of this inventory corresponds to numbers which, together with the monogram AF, were incised at some time in the nineteenth century on items in the collection. Moore's article includes a concordance of the numbered items in  the second inventory with the numbered lots in the 1884 sale, and the NGA plate, which is inscribed ""af 3"" on its reverse, is identified as number 3 in part II of the second inventory (this part, of six, is described as ""Middle sized plates & dishes exceeding 12 1/2 inches in diameter, & not exceeding 15 1/2 inches [Total: 14]"").

      The second inventory also includes the initials ""AF"" in the margin next to 99 of the total of 276 maiolica entries. Moore concludes that ""these initials are almost certainly [Andrew IV's] record of his own purchases"" and that ""by inference, the remaining items [with three exceptions]...stand the greatest chance of having been acquired by Sir Andrew Fountaine, the collection's originator, in the eighteenth century. Since the NGA plate entry does not have an ""AF"" next to it in the margin, it is probably one of the items acquired by Sir Andrew.

[1] A photograph of c. 1862, neg. 3600, in the photographic archive of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, shows that the dish was at that time in Barker's collection.

[2] Timothy H. Wilson, author of the NGA systematic catalogue entry published in 1993, provided this additional information in August 2000. Mrs. Benzon lent the dish to an exhibition at Wrexham that opened 22 July 1876.

[3] The dish corresponds exactly to the description of the one exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club exhibitions in 1887 and 1910 by ""Mr. Natorp"" and Sir Francis Beaufort Palmer respectively, and is almost certainly the same piece.

[1] For a detailed study of the Fountaine collection of maiolica see Andrew Moore, ""The Fountaine Collection of Maiolica,"" _The Burlington Magazine_ 130, no. 1023 (June 1988): 435-447. Sir Andrew Fountaine (1676-1753) was the originator of the collection.As Moore writes, no record of individual items in the collection dating from Fountaine's time is known, but eighteenth century texts and Narford Hall inventories describing the collection in general terms do exist, and it is likely that Fountaine acquired much of the collection during his second Grand Tour that began in 1714. Sir Andrew's heirs added items to the collection, and it appears that it was the Andrew Fountaine who lived 1808-1873 (Moore describes him as Andrew IV) who added most substantially to the core of his ancestor's original collection. 

      At the time of Andrew IV's 1835 inheritance from his father (also Andrew Fountaine, 1770-1835), he prepared an inventory of the maiolica that Moore publishes in the first appendix of his article. The NGA plate is probably identifiable with number 14, on shelf III (which held ""Small Raphael ware dishes""), and described as ""Nymphs bathing border of fruit and foliage."" Between 1855 and his death in 1873, Andrew IV compiled a second inventory, which is contained in the ""Family Book,"" held at Narford Hall at the time of Moore's article. The numbering of this inventory corresponds to numbers which, together with the monogram AF, were incised at some time in the nineteenth century on items in the collection. Moore's article includes a concordance of the numbered items in the second inventory with the numbered lots in the 1884 sale, and the NGA plate, which has ""af 67"" inscribed on its reverse, is identified as number 67 in part I of the second inventory (this part, of six, is described as ""Small Plates less than 12 1/2 inches in diameter Total 131"").

      The second inventory also includes the initials ""AF"" in the margin next to 99 of the total of 276 maiolica entries. Moore concludes that ""these initials are almost certainly [Andrew IV's] record of his own purchases"" and that ""by inference, the remaining items [with three exceptions]...stand the greatest chance of having been acquired by Sir Andrew Fountaine, the collection's originator, in the eighteenth century. Since the NGA plate entry does not have an ""AF"" next to it in the margin, it is probably one of the items acquired by Sir Andrew.

[1] Annotation accompanying the copy of the catalogue in the archives of Christie, Manson & Woods, London.

[2] Maurice Brockwell, _Catalogue of the Pictures at Doughty House, Richmond, and Elsewhere in the Collection of Sir Frederick Cook, Bt._, 3 vols., London, 1913-1915: 3:no. 426, states that the painting was purchased from J. Charles Robinson in 1874 for 350 pounds. An annotation, probably by Brockwell, in a copy of the 1915 Cook collection catalogue belonging to Brenda, Lady Cook (St. Brelade, Jersey, England), reads: ""Bought from or per JCR 11/2/1874."" Lady Cook kindly showed this annotation to Elon Danziger, assistant in the department of northern Renaissance painting, in 2001. Brockwell 1932, vi, observes that Robinson, who had been Surveyor of the Pictures for Queen Victoria, often advised Cook on purchases. In this instance he may have acted as agent.

[1] The provenance given here is an updated version of the one published in the 1993 NGA systematic catalogue, which originally listed the first owner as ""Casa Murata,"" Florence, based on Jean Charles Davillier, _Les origines de la porcelaine en Europe_, Paris and London, 1882: 116-117, no. 32, in which it is noted: ""Despite the generous efforts of Professor Marco Spallanzani in Florence libraries, no information on the 'Casa Murata' has been traced."" However, Alessandro Alinari, _La Porcellana dei Medici: Bibliografia ragionata e catalogo essenziale_, Ferrara, 2009: 76, no. 27, notes that Davillier's ""Casa Murata"" was probably the Casamorata family, whose villa in Florence, owned by the Medici family in the 16th century, is located in the street which still bears the family's name. See also Alinari's letter of 1 April 1994 to Timothy Wilson, copy in NGA curatorial files.

[4] Georges Vogt, _La Porcelaine_, Paris, 1893: 83 fig. 30, identifies the NGA flask as with the ""Collection Milet."" Milet was a potter and eventually director of the Sevres Porcelain Manufactory, and was also a friend and collaborator of Davillier. He had a collection of porcelain and other works of art.
 
[5] Alfred André was a goldsmith, enamelist, and restorer of Medieval and Renaissance objets d'art, who studied and reactivated old enameling methods. He had workshops for various decorative arts techniques in a wing of his Paris home, working with other goldsmiths, hardstone carvers and ceramists. André transferred half of the business to his son Léon in 1905, after the latter's marriage. This is likely how Léon acquired the flask, and sold it to Morgan the same year. Léon André took complete control of the shop in 1907.

Edith Standen, in Widener collection records (copies in NGA curatorial files), gives the November date of the statement as the purchase date for the flask.

[1] Thame Park, originally a monastery, was acquired by Sir John Williams, later Lord Williams of Thame, in the mid 16th century.  At his death in 1559 Thame Park was inherited by his eldest daughter, Isabella, who was married to Richard Wenman. Their grandson, Sir Richard Wenman, was created Viscount Wenman of Tuam in the Irish peerage in 1628. Succeeding male members of the family inherited Thame Park, through Philip, sixth Viscount Wenman, who died in 1760, and whose son and successor, the seventh and last Viscount, died in 1800 leaving no children. The seventh Viscount's heir was his nephew, William Richard Wykeham, who died a few months after him, leaving a daughter, Sophia Elizabeth, to succeed to the ownership of Thame Park. She was created a baroness in her own right in 1834, and she remained unmarried.  At her death in 1870, her successor was her cousin, Herbert Wykeham, who was followed by his brother, Aubrey Wykeham, who had married Georgiana Musgrave.  Aubrey and Georgiana's son, Wenman Aubrey Wykeham-Musgrave, owned Thame Park by 1909, and after his death it was sold to W.H. Gardiner, who owned the property by 1922.  Mr. and Mrs. Frank Bowden bought Thame Park in 1938, after it had been owned for a time by Lady Forbes-Leith of Fyvie, and the Bowdens owned it until at least 1957.  See Arthur Oswald, ""Thame Park, Oxfordshire-I"" and ""Thame Park, Oxfordshire-II"", _Country Life_ CXXII, no. 3175 (21 and 28 November 1957): 1092-1095 and 1148-1151; G.

[1] Harold E. Wethey, _El Greco and his School_ 2 (Princeton, 1962): 247, no. X-401, identifies the NGA _Saint Martin and the Beggar_ as the one sold as part of the Baron Taylor collection.  The only information provided in the sale catalogue for lot 22 is the title and artist (El Greco). It is therefore impossible to identify which of the five small versions of _St. Martin and the Beggar_ was sold at the 1880 auction.  August L. Mayer, ""_St. Martin and the Beggar_ by El Greco,"" _Apollo_ 10 (1929):151 claims the the number ""387"" inscribed at the lower right indicates that the NGA painting was once in the Spanish royal collection, but he does not provide any evidence to support this assertion. The number 387 is not used to identify a painting of Saint Martin or a work of any subject by El Greco in the published inventories of the Spanish collections. The unpublished inventories of the Spanish royal collections have not been checked.



[2] Manuel B. Cossío, _El Greco_ (Madrid, 1908): 600, no.  309.  It seems likely that this is the painting listed as ""_Portrait_ (perhaps _San Luis_)"" in the collection of M. L. Manzi, Paris, by George C. Williamson, ed., _Bryan's Dictionary of Painters and Engravers_, 5 vols. (London, 1903-1905), 5:168. Both Saints Martin and Louis were frequently shown wearing armor.

Mayer, _Domenico Theotocopuli, El Greco_ (Munich, 1926): 48, no. 299, claims that the painting was included in the auctions of the Manzi collection. However, it is not mentioned in the catalogues of the auctions of paintings from the Manzi collection held at Galérie Manzi, Joyant et Compagnie, Paris, 13-14 March 1919 and 13 December 1919, nor is it mentioned in contemporary articles on these auctions. See, e.g., Alexandre Arsene, ""Les collections Manzi,"" _Les Arts_ 5 (1919): 1-26.  It seems possible that the brothers Bernheim-Jeune purchased the painting from (Manzi, Joyant et Cie)--with which Louis Manzi was affiliated--sometime before 1919.

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

Because the measurements of the Kress painting correspond most closely to those of the smallest of the versions cited in the inventory of 1621 (see n. 2 below), it seems likely that the Kress painting was one of the two small versions recorded in 1614.

Because a _vara_ equals approximately 84 cm., the measurements of no.  41 correspond closely to those of the Kress painting. The difference in the numbers of large and small versions of the subject mentioned in the two inventories suggest that Jorge Manuel sold one of the two smaller paintings in his father's estate and that he or another artist in the workshop produced another large copy of the composition before 1621.  Alternatively, a mistake may have been made in one of the inventories.  Many previous scholars have maintained that the Kress painting was in the Spanish royal collection in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries:  Manuel B. Cossío, _El Greco_, Madrid, 1908: 362; Emilio H. del Villar, _El Greco en España_, Madrid, 1928: 132; Walter S. Cook, ""El Greco's _Laocoön_ in the National Gallery,"" _Gazette des Beaux-Arts_ 26 (1944): 262, n. 1; José Camón Aznar, _Domenico Greco_ , Madrid, 1950: 2:921; Harold E. Wethey, _El Greco and His School_, Princeton, 1962: 2:84, no. 127; Colin Eisler, _Paintings from the Samuel H. Kress Collection: European Schools Excluding Italian_, Oxford, 1977: 198, no. K1413; William B.  Jordan, _El Greco of Toledo_ [exh. cat.] (1982-1983), 257, no. 56.  However, it is likely that the royal inventories refer not to the Kress painting but to one of the larger versions cited in the 1621 inventory (nos. 179 and 180).  The relevant entries are as follows:  Alcázar, Madrid, Inventory of 1666, no. 520: ""3 varas casi en quadro de Lauconte y sus hijos de mano del Greco en 300 dicadps de plata"" (""3 _varas_, almost square, of Laocoön and his sons, by the hand of El Greco, at 300 silver _ducados_""). Harold E. Wethey, letter, 22 June 1969, NGA curatorial files.  Alcázar, Madrid, Inventory of 1686, no. 310: ""Un quadro de tres baras de largo casi quadrado de la Oconte y sus hijos de blanco y negro de mano del Griego, tiene Marco negro como las demas pinturas de esta pieza"" (""A painting, three _varas_ in width, almost square, of Laocoön and his sons, in white and black by the hand of El Greco, has a black frame like the other paintings in this room"").  Yves Bottineau, ""L'Alcázar de Madrid et l'inventaire de 1686: aspects de la cour d'Espagne au XVIIe siècle,"" _Bulletin Hispanique_ 60 (1958), 164.  Alcázar, Madrid, Inventory of 1701-1703, no. 119: ""Un cuadro de tres varas de largo quasi quadrado de laoconte y sus hijos de blanco y negro de mano del Griego con marco negro tasado en cien Doblons"" (""A painting three _varas_ in width, almost square, of Laocoön and his sons, in white and black by the hand of El Greco, with a black frame valued at 100 _doblones_"").  Gloria Fernández Bayton, ed., _Inventarios reales:  Testamentario del Rey Carlos II_, 6 vols., Madrid, 1975-: 1:29.  The dimensions given in all these inventories correspond to the now lost larger versions of the Laocoön but not to the Kress painting.    The Kress painting has also been related to references in the royal inventories of 1701-1703 and 1791 to an approximately square painting of Laocoön, about two _varas_ across, said to be a copy of Titian.  The width of this painting approximates that of the Kress painting.  However, it seems most unlikely that the Kress painting would have been described as a copy of Titian, especially because an original _Laocoön_ by El Greco and the copy after Titian were recorded in the royal collections at the same time (Fernández Bayton 1975-, 1:29, no. 119; 2:324, no. 581).  Spanish critics of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries carefully distinguished the styles of Titian and El Greco, and the compilers of the royal inventories probably would not have confused them.  See, e. g. Antonio Palomino de Castro y Velasco, _El Museo pictórico y escala óptica_,1715 and 1724, reprint ed., Madrid, 1947: 841; and Antonio Ponz, _Viaje de España_, ed. C. María de Rivero, Madrid, 1947: 640.

Basic biographical information about Fischer and Von Jeszenski von Mendelssohn is given in _Neue Deutsche Biographie_ 5, Munich, 1961: 180.  Walter S. Cook, ""El Greco's _Laocoön_ in the National Gallery,"" _Gazette des Beaux-Arts_ 26 (1944): 262, n. 1, maintains that the _Laocoön_ was purchased before 1914 by Fischer's wife, whom he misidentifies as Frau von Schwabach.  Because this painting was owned by the dealer Cassirer in 1915, this supposition is unlikely.  However, the painting may have been purchased by Fischer's wife before their marriage in 1919.  Frau von Schwabach may possibly have been an earlier owner, unrelated to Fischer. 

[9] The painting was on loan to the National Gallery, London, May 1934-December 1935; Kenneth Clark, ""Report: National Gallery, 1935,"" _National Gallery and Tate Gallery Directors' Reports 1935_, London, 1935: 4.  During the Second World War, Prince Paul, then resident in Johannesburg, arranged to have the painting at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, for safekeeping (David Edward Finley, _A Standard of Excellence: Andrew W. Mellon Founds the National Gallery of Art at Washington_, Washington, DC, 1973: 89).

Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

[2] These two sales were kindly brought to the Gallery's attention by Burton Fredericksen, after the publication of the systematic catalogue of Flemish paintings in the collection (see 11 February 2006 letter to Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr., in NGA curatorial files).

[3] The executors of Fesch's estate published a catalogue of the collection in 1841 (_Catalogue des tableaux composant la galerie de feu son eminence le Cardinal Fesch_, Rome, 1841) in which the painting, number 351, is described as being in the style of Rubens. The catalogue listed over 3,000 works, and the collection was being offered ""en bloc."" According to the Knoedler prospectus (in NGA curatorial files), the painting was sold at auction to Buchanan in 1844, who sold it to Holford the next year.

Clarke, Christie's, London, 14 May 1802, no. 33, bought in); George Hibbert [1757-1837], London; (his sale, Christie's, London, 13 June 1829, no. 36); Rev. Thomas Frognall Dibdin [d. 1847]; sold December 1829 to Joseph Neeld [d. 1856], Grittleton House, near Chippenham, Wiltshire; by inheritance to his brother, Sir John Neeld, 1st bt. [1805-1891], Grittleton House; by inheritance to his son, Sir Algernon William Neeld, 2nd bt. [1846-1900], Grittleton House; by inheritance to his brother, Sir Audley Dallas Neeld, 3rd bt. [1849-1941], Grittleton House; by inheritance to Joseph Neeld's descendant through an illegitimate daughter, Lionel William [Inigo-Jones] Neeld [d. 1956], Grittleton House; (his sale, Christie, Manson & Woods, London, 9 June 1944, no. 18); purchased by Koetser or Rocker.[1] (Wildenstein & Co., Paris, New York, and London); sold December 1944 to the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, New York;[2] gift 1946 to NGA.


[1] According to an undated letter from early 1986, an annotated copy of the 1944 Neeld sale catalogue at the Getty Provenance Index states that ""Rocker"" purchased lot 18 (Julia A. Armstrong to Suzannah Fabing, in NGA curatorial files). However, two other annotated copies of the sale catalogue (photocopies from both in NGA curatorial files, one from the Knoedler Library fiche of British sales) indicate that lot 18 was purchased by ""Koetser,"" almost certainly the dealer David M. Koetser. This theory is supported by a passage in _The Paintings of The Betty and David M. Koetser Foundation_ (introduction by Malcolm M. Waddingham, catalogue by Christian Klemm, Zurich and Doornspijk, 1988: 10), in which Koetser's purchase of ""the rare _Landscape with Peasants_ by Louis Le Nain"" is described. It is possible that ""Rocker"" was a pseudonym used by Koetser. It is not clear whether Koetser was buying for himself, or for, or with, Wildenstein. Koetser's letter of 20 January 1969 to Colin Eisler contains a list of some of the non-Italian paintings he sold to the Kress Foundation followed by the sentence ""And indirectly, Louis Le Nain's 'Landscape'..."" (copy in NGA curatorial files).

[2] The ""memorandum of agreement"" between Wildenstein and the Kress Foundation for the purchase of ten paintings, including Louis Le Nain's _Peasants in a Landscape_, is dated 28 December 1944 (copy in NGA curatorial files). Colin Eisler, _Paintings from the Samuel H. Kress Collection: European Schools Excluding Italian_, Oxford, 1977: 266 n. 14, incorrectly gives the date of the Kress acquisition as 1946, misspells Hibbert's name as Hibbard, and indicates the painting sold for fifty guineas in 1789, when the Ellis Waterhouse letter to which he refers only says the painting was _priced_ at fifty guineas.

[1] The cup was published in 1909 as belonging to the Wachtmeister collection at Knutstorp Castle in _Svenska Slott och Herresäten: vid 1900-talets början_, vol. 2, p. 186. According to oral tradition in the Wachtmeister family, the cup was given as a wedding gift to a family member by a close friend of Queen of Luise of Sweden around 1860. It is most likely the counterpart to a similar nautilus cup in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, which was acquired as a bequest from King Karl XV in 1873. Given the similarities between the cups, it is reasonable to conclude that the Swedish royal family acquired two etched nautilus shells around 1670 from Amsterdam to be mounted as a pair of cups, which were kept in the royal collections until the latter half of the 1800s.

[1] José M. Pita Andrade, ""Los cuadros de Velázquez y Mazo que poseyó el séptimo Marques del Carpio,"" _Archivo Español de Arte_ 25 (1952): 227, identifies the painting as a work listed in the 1651 inventory of Haro y Guzmán.



[2] Several conflicting dates have been published regarding Count Harrach's acquisition of this painting. Walter W. S. Cook, ""Spanish Paintings in the National Gallery of Art,"" _Gazette des Beaux-Arts_, XXVIII (1945): 79, said that the portrait was ""acquired in 1677 in Madrid,"" while José López-Rey, _Velázquez. A Catalogue Raisonné of His Oeuvre_, (London, 1963): 316, stated that it was purchased in 1687.  José Gudiol, _Velázquez_ (1974): 150, suggested that Count Harrach bought the painting in 1687.  In his 1926 catalogue for the Harrach collection (_Katalog der Erlaucht Gräflich Harrach'schen Gemäldegalerie in Wien_), Hermann Ritschl noted that Count Harrach mentioned the painting in a 1690 document as ""ein Contrefait, Bruckstück von einem Mann im grauen Wamms mit dunklen Ermeln, kleinen Überschlag mit Spitzen, von Velasca.""



[3] See entry from the David Finley notebook, as well as the 30 May 1988 letter from Dr. Robert Keyszelitz of the Gallerie Harrach (both in NGA curatorial files).  Although the Finley entry identifies the owner as ""Harrach (Count Johann von H.),"" Keyszelitz states in his letter that when the painting was sold to Duveen's in 1930, Count Otto Harrach was the head of the family.  Upon his death in 1935, his son Count Johann inherited this position.

Steinberg [1914-1999], New York; purchased 1 June 2000 through (Richard Feigen and Co., New York) by NGA.


[1] This painting has been linked to a commission from Don Antonio Ruffo, an important art collector from Messina, to Artemisia Gentileschi: arguments in favor of this provenance can be found in Nicola Spinosa's essay in _Bernardo Cavallino (1616-1656)_, exh. cat., Museo Pignatelli, Naples, 1985: 188 and 219; Jozef Grabski, ""On Seicento Painting in Naples: Some Observations on Bernardo Cavallino, Artemisia Gentileschi and Others,"" _Artibus et Historiae_ 11 (1985): 23-63 (41-55); and especially R.  Ward Bissell, _Artemisia Gentileschi and the Authority of Art. Critical Reading and Catalogue Raisonné_, University Park, 1999: 287-288. However, a number of discrepancies between the inventory description of the Ruffo canvas and the NGA painting call this provenance into question. Furthermore, technical examination of the work has found no evidence of the separate hands of both Artemisia, to whom the commission was awarded, and Cavallino. It is therefore unlikely that the NGA painting is the one described in Ruffo's collection.

More recently, Christopher Marshall put forward another possible provenance for the work. The collection of Antonio Arici in Naples held ""a Galatea, with various _putti_, who rides on the sea...by Bernardo Cavalliero."" This connection, however, proves equally problematic. While the recorded dimensions correspond with those of the NGA 2000.61.1, it is rather surprising that the inventory, probably drawn up by Arici's own sister in 1744, would mistake the adult seafaring tritons in the NGA painting for _putti_ (Christopher R. Marshall, ""An early inventory reference and new technical information for Bernardo Cavallino's 'Triumph of Galatea',"" _The Burlington Magazine_ CXLVII (2005): 42-43. The connection with Arici was first suggested by Stefano Causa, ""Risarcimento di Onofrio Palumbo,"" _Paragone_ 37-8 (1993): 36 n. 29.

[1] Gerard Hoet, _Catalogus of Naamlyst van Schilderijen..._, 2 vols., The Hague, 1752, 2: 490. Van Slingeland's inventory describes two paintings as: ""Twee stukken, zynde het Gezigt van de Stad Dordrecht tot het huys Merwerde met veele Jachten en Scheepen, zynde een Rendevous daar Prins Maurits van Orange in een Chaloup met eenige andere Prince van de Stad na het jagt wert gevoert tegens over welke Chaloup een andere is waarinne Oldenbarnevelt overend staande op Prince Maurits siet, na het Leven, door Albert Kuyp. ieder h. 43 d. br. 64 en een half d."" [""Two pieces, being the view of the City of Dordrecht to the Huys Merwede with many yachts and ships, being a rendezvous there [of] Prince Maurits of Orange in a 'Chaloup' with several other Princes from the city brought over to the yacht across from this 'Chaloup' is another in which Oldenbarnevelt stands looking down on Prince Maurits, from life, by Aelbert Cuyp. each h. 43 d. w. 64 1/2 d.""] The description and dimensions seem to identify these paintings as Cuyp's _View on the Maas near Dordrecht_ at Waddesdon Manor and the Gallery's _The Maas at Dordrecht_. As Oldenbarnevelt was executed in 1619 and Prince Maurits had died in 1625, these identifications were clearly fanciful.

[2] A margin note in the NGA copy of the sale catalogue gives the buyer as Delfos (who was one of the auctioneers and also bought several other paintings in the sale), but a note in a copy at the British Museum Library gives the buyer as ""Rens."" Cornelis Hofstede de Groot, _A Catalogue Raisonné of the Works of the Most Eminent Dutch Painters of the Seventeenth Century_, trans. Edward G. Hawke, 8 vols., London, 1907-1927, 2: 17-18, no. 36, says lot 70, which he mistakenly believed to be the Waddesdon Manor painting (Stephen Reiss, _Aelbert Cuyp_, Boston, 1975: 145, no. 106), was sold to ""Reus,"" and although the note in the copy of the catalogue in the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorisches Documentatie, The Hague, could be read as either ""Reus"" or ""Rens,"" the one in the British Museum Library is not ambiguous. 

[3] William Buchanan, _Memoirs of Painting_, 2 vols., London, 1824: 2:192. The dates for Delahante's ownership are from the Duveen prospectus for the painting, in NGA curatorial files. Hume lent the painting to an exhibition in 1815.

[1] The only source to mention Vandergucht (also written van der Gucht) is the Knoedler prospectus for the painting, in NGA curatorial files, which mistakenly lists the Vandergucht sale of 1777 that did not include any paintings by Cuyp. See instead Frank Simpson, “Dutch Paintings in England before 1760,” _The Burlington Magazine_ 95 (January 1953): 41, who lists a ""Landscape with Cattle, etc."" by Cuyp as being no. 66 in a 1757 Vandergucht sale in London, where it was bought by “Jennens.” The listing appears in one of two manuscript volumes in the Victoria and Albert Museum library, London, that contain transcripts of catalogues of the principal collections of paintings sold in England between 1711 and 1759. Jennens was likely Charles Jennens, whom Simpson describes as having brought together by the mid-eighteenth century the largest collection of Dutch paintings then in England. Without further description or size information in the transcription, however, it is not possible to know whether the painting in question is identical to _Herdsmen Tending Cattle_.

[2] The Knoedler prospectus, in NGA curatorial files, says that Penton acquired the painting at the Vandergucht sale. Penton certainly owned the picture by 1760, the date on François Vivares’ reproductive engraving, entitled _The Evening_. It depicts the composition in reverse but, with the exception of a group of two birds, it is otherwise identical. This print is listed in Charles LeBlanc, _Manuel de l’amateur d’estampes_, 4 vols., Paris, 1854: 4:141, no. 20; and Andreas Andresen, _Handbuch für Kupferstichsammler..._, 2 vols., Leipzig, 1873: 2:678, no. 17.

[1] The early provenance of the painting, through 1833, was kindly provided by Burton B. Fredericksen in a letter to Arthur Wheelock, dated 18 December 2002, in NGA curatorial files. Marivault's collection was offered for sale _en bloc_ in January 1806; concerning this exhibition/sale, and the June 1806 sale and confusion surrounding its dates, see also Burton B. Fredericksen and Benjamin Peronnet, eds., _Répertoire des tableaux vendus en France au XIXe siècle_, one volume in two parts, Los Angeles, 1998: pt. 1:32-33, 35-36, cats. 96 and 109. William W. Robinson, in a letter to Arthur Wheelock of 12 March 1996 (in NGA curatorial files), noted a sale record in the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie (RKD), The Hague, that gives the dates as 10-11 June 1809. However, the description of lot number 29 is identical to the description in the 1806 catalogue, so the 1809 date is likely in error. Frits Lugt (_Répertoire des catalogues de ventes publiques_, 4 vols., The Hague, 1938-1964: vol. 1) cross-references three sales to each other--Lugt numbers 6281, 7604, and 8017--that all likely refer to the 1806 sale, which is Lugt number 7119. 

[2] Fredericksen and Peronnet 1998, pt. 1:32, cat. 96.

[3] As Fredericksen points out in his letter (see note 1), the paintings in this sale are described as having been ""just imported from France,"" but the description is brief and the dimensions are not given, so the painting's identity is uncertain.

[4] The provenance from 1856 to 1919 comes from a three-page typewritten pamphlet concerning the work written by W. Roberts in 1919. It was probably produced for Sulley and Co., London, and is in the library of M. Knoedler & Co., New York (copy in NGA curatorial files).

[5] Stockbook no. 5563, Thomas Agnew & Sons, London. A handwritten note by Frits Lugt in a copy of the 1935 Knoedler exhibition catalogue that included the painting (now at the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie, The Hague) reads: ""fraai, heb ick bij Agnew  1920 gemist.""

[6] N.B. Hersloff, then resident in Pinehurst, North Carolina, wrote to Duveen Brothers, Inc. on 15 November 1930 to ask if the dealer would be interested in buying the painting. He was told, however, in letter of 20 November 1930, that the firm did not buy works by the artist. (Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles: reel 321, box 466, folder 2; copies in NGA curatorial files)

[7] On 7 April 1933 the picture was received by Knoedler, on consignment from ""H. B. Hersloff, Compania De Trafico Y Formento"" (no address given, transaction no. CA 513 in the stockbook). It was returned to the consigner on 8 May 1934, but returned again in January 1935 (transaction CA 768, again from ""H.B. Hersloff""). However, the painting is listed in the 1935 Knoedler exhibition catalogue as having come from the collection of ""Nils B. Hersloff, Esq.,"" rather than ""H.B.,"" as was entered in the normally reliable Knoedler stockbooks. (The stockbook information was kindly provided by Nancy C. Little, librarian at M.

The measurements, given according to the Rhineland Scale, are approximately 118 x 168 centimeters.

[2] ""_The Finding of Moses_ by Sébastien Bourdon,"" sold by the dealer Bryan in London in 1801, in a sale which included works from the Robit collection, may be NGA 1961.9.65, but we have no evidence beyond the artist's name and the title. See Colin Eisler, _Paintings from the Samuel H. Kress Collection: European Schools Excluding Italian_, Oxford, 1977: 289-290.

[3] Nicholson lent the painting to the 1937 Paris and 1939 Liège exhibitions.

Clark ""purchased the entire assemblage in 1905 from a Mr. Field, perhaps a friend or agent resident at Scheveningen in Holland, 'through Dr. A. Bredius' who was presumably the advisor and middle-man with links to the Dutch antique trade.

According to The Provenance Index, J. Paul Getty Trust, Santa Monica, California, Edward Cheney [1803-1884] is listed as the inheritor of the Badger Hall estate from his brother, R.

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

framed: 161.9 x 121.9 cm (63 3/4 x 48 in.)",,,"Greuze, Jean-Baptiste",Jean-Baptiste Greuze,"The sitter, Ange Laurent de La Live de Jully [1725-1779], Paris, probably 1759;[1] probably by inheritance to his second daughter, Louise de La Live, comtesse de Fezensac [d. 1829 or 1832]; by inheritance to her son, Raymond Aimery de Montesquiou, duc de Montesquiou-Fezensac [1784-1867]; by inheritance to his daughter, Oriane Henriette de Montesquiou, vicomtesse [Charles] de Goyon [d. 1887], by 1874 until at least 1885; Alexandre Léon Joseph, comte de Laborde [b. 1853, a descendant of the sitter's brother-in-law], Paris, by 1927; purchased January 1937 by (Duveen Brothers, Inc., London, New York, and Paris);[2] sold 1942 to the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, New York;[3] gift 1946 to NGA.


[1] The painting is undocumented between the catalogue of La Live de Jully's collection published in 1764 (_Catalogue historique du cabinet de peinture et sculpture françoise de M. De Lalive_,  p. 55), and its exhibition in Paris in 1874, when it was in the collection of the vicomtesse Charles de Goyon, a direct descendant of the sitter. The vicomtesse also lent the painting to an exhibition in Paris in 1885. Munhall (in Edgar Munhall, _Jean-Baptiste Greuze 1725-1805_, exh. cat., The Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford; The California Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco; Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dijon; Hartford and Lille, 1976: 64) follows the Duveen provenance that accompanied the painting on its acquisition by the Kress Foundation in 1942. Eisler (Colin Eisler, _Paintings from the Samuel H. Kress Collection: European Schools Excluding Italian_, Oxford, 1977: 327, no. 29) comments that there is no ""documentary foundation for most of the sequence"" between 1764 and 1874 and follows the provenance in  L. Clément de Ris, _Les Amatuers de Autrefois_, Paris, 1877: 401-402. The Clément de Ris-Eisler provenance, in spite of some innaccuracies, remains tenable, especially in its credible presumption that the painting remained with La Live de Jully's heirs. Martha Hepworth of the Getty Provenance Index kindly helped clarify this issue and corrected the Clément de Ris-Eisler provenance (letter of 11 July 1989 in NGA curatorial files).

[2] The painting was lent by Laborde to exhibitions in 1927 and 1935. Duveen Brothers' Paris office cabled on 30 December 1936, asking the New York office if they were interested in ""Master's finest man portrait."" The purchase followed quickly, as indicated by a further cable of 9 January 1937, requesting cash to pay for the painting and by an entry in the dealer's General Stock Books that reads: ""GREUZE - Mons Ange Laurent de la Live de Jully Playing the Harp. Purchased from Mr. Laporte [_sic_] January 1937."" (Duveen Brothers Records, Research Library, The Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles, accession no. 960015, reel 66, box 186, and reel 103, box 248, folder 13; copies in NGA curatorial files).

Kress Foundation, New York;[4] gift 1961 to NGA.

[1] A photograph of the painting in the Witt Library, London, is inscribed with the information that the painting was once in the collection of Augustus III, elector of Saxony (see photocopy in NGA curatorial files.)

[2] Karl Haberstock appears to have handled two Bellotto views of Munich: the Gallery version and one that was sold to the Sonderauftrag Linz, processed through the Munich Central Collecting Point (no. 7573) in 1945, transferred in 1949 to the German government, and sent to the Auswärtig Amt in 1962 (see photocopies from the Bundesarchiv, Koblenz, in NGA curatorial files). This other version, first published by Andrzej Rottermund in 1998 (see bibliography), was auctioned by Koller International Auctions in Zurich on 1 October 2021. One of the two Bellottos was acquired by Haberstock from Sabin in London in April 1928 (see photocopies from Haberstock-archiv in NGA curatorial files), and at least one was still in his possession as of 1936, per Hellmuth Allwill Fritzsche, Bernardo Bellotto, genannt Canaletto, Burg-bei-Magdeburg, 1936: 116.

[3] According to Saemy Rosenberg (letter of 7 December 1955, to NGA curator Fern Rusk Shapley, in NGA curatorial files), the painting was acquired by a private collector from a Dresden collection during World War II. Stefan Kozakiewicz, in his 1972 catalogue raisonné, identified the collector as Gustav Mez, a German resident in Switzerland (see bibliography). It is possible that both this painting and its companion (NGA 1961.9.63) were acquired by Mez from Haberstock in 1929, when the third painting of the group (replicas of the originals in the electoral palace painted for Elector Maximilian III Joseph) was sold.

46036,1,1960.6.12,8497,The Happy Family,c. 1775,1775,painting,1775,1751 to 1775,oil on canvas,overall (oval): 53.9 x 65.1 cm (21 1/4 x 25 5/8 in.),,,"Fragonard, Jean Honoré",Jean Honoré Fragonard,"Possibly collection of Monsieur Servat, at least in 1777, or possibly (sale of Comtesse du Barry, Radix de Sainte Foy, La Ferré, et al., by Alexandre J. Paillet at Hôtel d'Aligre, Paris, 17 February 1777, no. 55);[1] purchased by Aubert.[2] Duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt [1747-1827]. Poilleux collection, Paris.

Timken [1866-1949], New York, by 1935;[5] by inheritance to his widow, Lillian Guyer Timken [1881-1959], New York; bequest 1960 to NGA.


[1] This provenance is a revised and clarified version of the provenance published in Philip Conisbee et al., _French Paintings of the Fifteenth through the Eighteenth Century_, The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, Washington, D.C., 2009: 176, no. 26.

Numerous variants and engraved versions of the painting exist, and in the absence of accurate size information and detailed descriptions, it is difficult to establish with certainty the early provenance. Georges Wildenstein (_The Paintings of Fragonard_, New York, 1960: 280, no. 368) identifies the NGA painting with the one that appeared in a February 1777 sale of works from several collections; dimensions are given in the sale catalogue and they are close to those of NGA 1960.6.12. Pierre Rosenberg (_Fragonard_, exh. cat., Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, Paris; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1987: 456-459, no. 222) suggests an additional possibility, that the NGA painting was the one after which Nicolas Delaunay made an engraving that was issued in 1777. According to the inscription on the print, the original painting belonged to ""Monsieur Servat."" The engraving gives no indication of the size of the painting, but the image agrees with the particulars of the NGA painting.

[2] Aubert is identified by Wildenstein (see note 1) as ""the jeweller."" 

The Wildenstein provenance includes a Mesnard de Clesle sale on 5 January 1804, in which the painting was supposedly lot 22 as _Un ménage rustique_. However, Frits Lugt, _Répertoire des catalogues de ventes publiques intéressant l'art ou la curiosité_, 4 vols., The Hague, 1938-1964, lists no sales on this date. There was a Mesnard de Clesle sale three days earlier, on 2 January 1804 (Lugt no. 6728), but it only included a small number of paintings, none of them by Fragonard. Jean-Pierre Cuzin, _Jean-Honoré Fragonard: Vie et oeuvre, Catalogue complet des peintures_, Paris, 1987: 319, no. 311, 
matches the Wildenstein reference to a drawing by that title in the 1804 sale, but does not correct the sale date. The painting did not appear either in an earlier Mesnard de Clesle sale on 4 December 1786, and days following (Lugt no. 4101). 

[3] Guinle was the son of Eduardo P. Guinle, patriarch of the immensely wealthy Brazilian family whose company received in the late 19th century the concession to build and operate until 1972 the country's major port of Santo. Between 1909 and 1914, the younger Eduardo built in Rio de Janeiro the Palácio Laranjeiras, a Beaux-Arts mansion (now the residence of the city's governor) that housed an art collection that included paintings, furnitures, tapestries, and nearly two hundred bronze sculptures by Antoine-Louis Barye.

[4] The sequence of owners from La Rochefoucault-Liancourt to Ambatielos, minus Wildenstein, is first published in the catalogue of a 1936 exhibition that included the painting (_Catalogue of the Twentieth Anniversary Exhibition of the Cleveland Museum of Art: The Official Art Exhibition of the Great Lakes Exposition_, exh. cat., Cleveland Museum of Art, 1936: 32, no. 59, in which the final name is incorrectly spelled Ambaticlos). Wildenstein is included in the provenance thanks to Diana Kostyrko, who has kindly shared her suggestion that an entry in the dealer René Gimpel's diary (_Journal d'un collectionneur_, Paris, 1963: 112) dated 6 March 1919, in which he records receiving a letter from Nathan Wildenstein reporting a sale of four small Fragonards to Ambatielos, refers to the NGA painting and three others (see her e-mails of 15 and 17 July 2014, in NGA curatorial files). The painting was included in a 1912 exhibition at Wildenstein, so perhaps the painting was part of their stock from then until the sale to Ambatielos. Nicolas Ambatielos was a Greek ship owner who lost his fortune in the early 1920s as the result of a failed ship-building contract with the British government. 

[5] The Timkens lent the painting to an exhibition in New York in 1935.

[2] Esmé Edwards married the Hon. Gilbert Irby, but later took the name of Smyth when she inherited Ashton Court after her mother's death in 1914. Her mother, Emily Frances Way (1835-1914), was married twice, first to George Oldham Edwards, who died in 1883, then in 1884 to her cousin, Greville Upton (who became Greville Smyth by Royal License in 1859 in order to inherit the Smyth estates, and who died in 1901). See Anton Bantock, _The Inside Story of the Smyths of Ashton Court_, Bristol, 1980. The painting was not included in her estate sale, conducted at Ashton Court by John E. Pritchard & Co., 3-6 and 10-13 July 1947; see Egerton 2007, 486.

[3] The full name of the 21st Earl was John George Charles Henry Alton Alexander Chetwynd Chetwynd-Talbot. The painting is listed in a January 1953 catalogue of his pictures, where the entry includes the information about the Earl's purchase from Sabin: Anthony Crofton, ""A Catalogue of the Pictures at Ingestre Hall, Staffordshire, Belonging to The Rt. Hon. The Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford,"" in _Collections for a History of Staffordshire Edited by The Staffordshire Record Society..._, London, 1954: 73, no. 46.

Clarke [1848-1931], New York;[3] his estate; sold as part of the Clarke collection on 29 January 1936, through (M. Knoedler & Co., New York), to The A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, Pittsburgh; gift 1942 to NGA.

[1] The early provenance of the portrait is documented only by a letter from Tom Connell of James Connell and Sons, London, dated 25 September 1909, to Louis Ralston (NGA curatorial file).  Clarke may have been given this letter in 1923.  He apparently had asked Louis Ralston about the provenance of the portrait, for Ralston wrote on 1 June 1923 that he would ""take up the matter"" with Mr. Connell in London ""and advise you of the result.""



[2] Melissa De Medeiros, librarian, M. Knoedler & Co., confirmed the purchase by Knoedler in a letter dated 7 March 1992 (NGA curatorial file).  Ellsworth, a financier and art collector, also sold his collection of books and manuscripts in 1923 for $450,000; _The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography_, 63 vols, Clifton, New Jersey, 1893-1894, 26:176 and _Who's Who in America_, vol. 8, Chicago, 1914, 727.



[3] The name of the seller and the date of purchase are recorded in a copy of _Portraits by Early American Painters of the Seventeenth, Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries Collected by Thomas B. Clarke_, Exh. cat., Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1928, annotated with information from files of M. Knoedler & Co., NY (copy in NGA curatorial records and in NGA library).

[1] The provenance information for the ""Faience: Delft"" is recorded in NGA curatorial files in this way: ""Purchased by Senator Clark from Mr. Field Scheveninges, Holland, 1905. Through Dr. A. Bredius."" An extensive report on the Corcoran Deltware, maiolica, and ""Palissy-ware,"" prepared in 2009 by Robin J.C. Hildyard and Jennifer Hawkins Opie (in NGA curatorial files), interpreted the statement to mean that William A. Clark ""purchased the entire assemblage in 1905 from a Mr. Field, perhaps a friend or agent resident at Scheveningen in Holland, 'through Dr. A. Bredius' who was presumably the advisor and middle-man with links to the Dutch antique trade. [Bredius was a well-known art historian, collector, and museum curator and director.] Many of the objects still carry labels for one particular dealer at Scheveningen, H. Fuld..."" It is possible that ""Mr. Field"" and ""H. Fuld"" were the same; the printed labels read ""H. Fuld"" at the top, ""Scheveningue"" at the bottom, ""Garanti Ancien"" in the center, and above this last in the center, a handwritten number.

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

Clarke [1848-1931], New York;[3] his estate; sold as part of the Clarke collection 29 January 1936, through (M. Knoedler & Co., New York), to The A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, Pittsburgh; gift 1947 to NGA.

[1] _Catalogue of the Paintings and Other Objects of Interest Belonging to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania_, Philadelhia, 1872: 8, no. 9.  Mrs. Whitney deposited the portrait at the society on November 11, 1872.  She was Matlack's great-granddaughter; her mother Rebecca Bryan Schott (Mrs. James Schott, 1787-1871), was the daughter of Matlack's daughter Martha Matlack Bryan (Mrs. Guy Bryan, 1770-1814). (Information in NGA curatorial files).



[2]  The evidence of James S. Whitney's ownership of the portrait is an undated handwritten label on the back of the frame, which reads: ""Timothy Matlack/ Born Haddonfield NJ/ in the year 1730, and Died near/ Homesburg, Pa. April 15th 1829/ Deposited by James S. Whitney, and subject to his order."" His relationship to Mrs. Whitney, the previous owner, is unknown.  Her will (Philadelphia Register of Wills, W-1225-1889, and that of her husband (Philadelphia Register of Wills, W-64-1888) do not mention a James S. Whitney.  Anna Wells Rutledge and James W. Lane, ""110 Paintings in the Clarke Collection"", unpublished typescript, NGA Department of Curatorial Records, 1952: 144, suggested that James S. Whitney was her brother (probably an error for ""brother-in-law"").  They note that he withdrew the portrait from the Historical Society sometime after 1907.  The will of a James S. Whitney (died 1921; Philadelphia Register of Wills W-1045-1921) lists his address as 1627 Sumner Street, and indicates four children: Asa W., Thomas B., Anne Wakefield and Emma S. Whitney.  Thomas was given all the ""books, pictures, furniture and other articles"" not specifically given to other children; however, the inventory lists only ""5 oil paintings,"" and these are probably the ""five marine paintings by James Hamilton"" specifically given to his daughters.



[3] C. K. Johnson offered the portrait to Clarke in his letter of 27 January 1923 (NGA Clarke files).  The date of purchase and name of the seller are recorded in an annotated copy of _Portraits by Early American Artists of the Seventeenth, Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries Collected by Thomas B.

[1] Peter Barlow, a New York jurist and magistrate, was a collateral descendant of the sitter, and in 1914 donated to several American museums plaster casts of the Houdon marble bust of his ancestor (see documentation in NGA curatorial files).

An article in _The New York Times_ of 7 April 1912, ""Magistrate Barlow Finds Bust of Ancestor,"" recounts the history of the marble bust from which the casts were made. Peter Barlow told newspaper that the bust was on exhibition in the Paris Salon in 1804, and that the sitter, Joel Barlow (1754-1812), an American diplomat, probably brought it to the United States in 1805 when he returned to the U.S. and took up residence in Washington, D.C. Several years after his death, Joel Barlow's immediate descendants took the bust with them when they moved to far western Pennsylvania. The last owner of the bust was H.P.

[1] Helen W. Henderson's opening comments in the brochure accompanying the 1943 exhibition _Jacob Eichholtz, 1776-1842, American Artist_ at the Philadelphia Art Alliance, report: ""A peculiarly touching incident was a visit to the outskirts of Lancaster to see the collection of a grandniece of the painter's. She sat in her bower surrounded by these souvenirs of a rich past. A particularly charming phase of the artist's work is a series of small oval portraits on wood.  Many of them are family portraits and we were fortunate in procuring four from her collection.""

[1] Londonderry House, formerly Holdernesse House, was bought from the 6th lord Middleton in 1822 by the 3rd marquess of Londonderry, and in the next few years was almost entirely rebuilt. Among the collection of marbles at the house, this sculpture is one that has been assumed to have been acquired by the 3rd marquess while he was Ambassador in Vienna from 1814 to 1822, but there appears to be no proof of this. A letter the marquess wrote from Rome on 20 February 1823 to one of the Wyatts concerning the project for rebuilding Holdernesse House confirms his presence there, and another possibility is that the sculpture was acquired during this visit, not long after Canova's death on 13 October 1822. See the catalogue of the 16 November 1962 Sotheby's sale (p. 14), and H. Montgomery Hyde, _Londonderry House and Its Pictures_, London, 1937: 16, 20, 21.

[3] Lazarus acted as the Gibbs' agent in the sale.  After agreeing upon the price, he wrote Coolidge on 27 June 1872 that he was sending the portraits to Boston the next day with some documents concerning their history.  These were his copies of letters written to Mrs. Gibbs in the 1850s certifying that the portraits were painted by Stuart for Colonel Gibbs (copies, NGA curatorial files).

Dr. Hermann [1860-1953] and Dr. Gottfried [1862-1924] Eissler, Vienna, by 1908.[1] Possibly Honig collection, Vienna. (sale, Wawra, Vienna, 17 March 1917, no. 165).[2] Acquired 1970s in Switzerland by John and Paul Herring, New York.


[1] The picture is first associated with the Eissler collection of Vienna in Arthur Roessler, _Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller_, Vienna, 1908. According to Rupert Feuchtmüller, _Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller 1793-1865_, Vienna and Munich, 1996: no. 137, the Eissler picture was later acquired by Hitler's Sonderauftrag Linz. However, this Linz provenance should be associated instead with Feuchtmüller no. 136, ""Portrait of a Cartographer and his Wife,"" now in the possession of the Westfälisches Landesmuseum in Münster. No. 136 is another version of the dual portrait from the same year with almost identical dimensions as the NGA picture. Although similar, the compositions are distinguished by the dress of the woman, what she is holding in her hand, and the background, among several other differences.

      Feuchtmüller no. 136 is illustrated on the website lostart.de, which lists those objects returned from the Allies to the German government after World War II and still in German Federal custody. On the website the Waldmüller is listed as Munich no. 9536, meaning that it was recovered by the Allies and processed through the Munich Central Collecting Point as no. 9536. The property card for no. 9536 indicates that the painting was Linz no. 2306 and had been acquired for Linz from the Galerie St. Lucas, Vienna, in 1942 (copy in NGA curatorial files). The picture was turned over to the German government in 1948 and remains the property of the Federal government, on loan to the Münster museum.  This information is confirmed by communication with Birgit Schwarz, author of _Hitler's Museum_, in which the Waldmüller figures as no. XVI/34. There is no doubt that the Feuchtmüller catalogue erroneously associates the Eissler picture with the version that was in the Linz collection.

[2] The NGA, Feuchtmüller no. 137, figures in a 1917 sale at Wawra, Vienna, of an ""important Viennese collector."" In a copy of the catalogue in the archives of the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna, the painting is annotated as having sold for 26.000 Kronen. The files at the Belvedere also include another annotation to this sale as follows: ""Auktion Wawra 1917 (Honig)."" This suggests that Honig was either the buyer or the seller in 1917. In either case, the picture would have left the Eissler collection by that time. In Frimmel's 1913 _Lexikon der Wiener Gemäldesammlungen_ it is already noted that of the many Waldmüllers owned by the Eisslers, some had already left the collection.  The 1925 estate sale of Dr. Gottfried Eissler included several Waldmüllers, but not the one in question, and there is no reason to suspect that the Waldmüller re-entered the Eissler collection after 1917.

      The name Honig may refer to the Jewish Viennese collectors Josef (d. 1930) and Vally Honig. Vally had remarried in 1938, to a Norwegian; nonetheless she was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942. The director of the Österrichische Galerie, Bruno Grimschitz, prepared the property declaration of her collection, which included a few Waldmüllers, but not the one in question (see Sophie Lillie, _Was Einmal War_, Vienna, 2003: 521-523), and as Grimschitz was an expert on Waldmüller's work, there is little chance he would have misidentified the paintings in the Honig collection at the time of Mrs. Honig's deportation. It is therefore possible that Honig was the seller of the painting in question in 1917. In 1957 Grimschitz lists the location of the painting in question as unknown (_Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller_, Salzburg, 1957: 287, no. 130).

The catalogue describes the 24 paintings as ""selected from the stock in their New York galleries"", and indicates that _Mending the Harness_ was purchased from the artist by Inglis. Walter P. Fearon, who was associated with Cottier Galleries until it disbanded in 1909, lent the painting to the 1912 inaugural exhibition at the Toledo (Ohio) Museum of Art.

[1] The triple portrait and Sully's pendant portraits of the children's parents were offered for sale by John Foster Jenkins, Jr., who advertised them in a brochure entitled ""Three Portraits by Thomas Sully.""  The Cleveland Museum of Art purchased the pendant portraits directly from him in 1916, but this part of the provenance of the National Gallery's painting is unclear.  Albert Rosenthal, in a letter to Chester Dale's secretary (10 December 1935, in NGA curatorial files), says that he purchased the painting from descendants of the David family through James B. Townshend, publisher of _American Art News_.  The painting was reproduced in that magazine (16 June 1917: 5) with the caption ""Recently sold to Mr. Albert Rosenthal of Phila.,"" and Dale collection notes in NGA curatorial files indicate the purchase was probably in May 1917. Cornelius Michaelsen wrote to Mr. Dale's secretary that he had purchased the painting from Mr. Rosenthal's private collection (letter of 15 September 1935 in NGA curatorial files).  However, other notes in the NGA curatorial files indicate the painting was purchased by Rosenthal jointly with Ehrich Galleries.  A 1918 publication by Ehrich Galleries (_One Hundred Early American Paintings_) lists paintings that have ""at various times been in our possession,"" and the absence of a private owner's name in the listing for the Sully implies ownership by them.  In the 1935 letter Rosenthal does not recall having lent it to any public exhibition, but it was in a 1931 exhibition at the New Jersey State Museum that he organized, and listed as lent by Ferergil Galleries, who were, with Ehrich Galleries, the main lenders.",Chester Dale Collection,Painting,,,0,CAB,,,,,2023-05-09 17:01:03.48-04,Q20185485,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/8ff2d6a0-c863-4127-bb9a-7edd6a56650a,"https://api.nga.gov/iiif/8ff2d6a0-c863-4127-bb9a-7edd6a56650a/full/!800,800/0/default.jpg"

Hallstrom [1886-1970], Sydney, Australia; gift 1951 to NGA.





[1] The painting was seen in 1895 at the home of Mrs. John Woodhouse Audubon by R.W. Shufeldt (""An Hitherto Unpublished Painting by Audubon,"" _The Wilson Bulletin_ XXII, no. I [March 1910]: 4-5). A note on the back of the painting that purports to explain the circumstances surrounding its creation is signed by ""M.R. Audubon."" John James Audubon had four children, one of whom was John Woodhouse Audubon [1812-1862]. The younger Audubon married twice; he had two children with his first wife, Maria Bachman [1816-1840], and seven with his second wife, Caroline Hall [1811-1899]. Of the seven, five lived to adulthood; Maria Rebecca Audubon [1843-1925], who signed the note on the back of the painting, was one of the daughters, and William Bakewell Audubon [1847-1932] was one of the sons. William left the United States for Australia in either 1880 or 1882, and he began a new life raising sheep near Yass, a small town about 250 miles west of Sydney. He married Lucy Ann Grovenor in 1885, and they had two children, Leonard Benjamin and Ella Caroline. According to a letter of 9 July 1952 from Ella Caroline Audubon to John Walker (in NGA curatorial files), Audubon paintings were sent to Australia in 1899 or 1900, which would correspond with the death of Caroline Hall Audubon on 1 February 1899. Miss Audubon's letter states that her father arrived in Australia 8 April 1880. However, Walter Audubon gives 21 January 1882 as the date that William Bakewell Audubon sailed for Australia, and he writes also that it was William who ""brought with him many paintings by his grandfather, John James Audubon"" (see Walter Audubon, _Last of the Audubon Line: The Descendants of John Woodhouse Audubon_, Franklin, North Carolina, 2002: 72-79).

Hallstrom [1886-1970], Sydney, Australia; gift 1951 to NGA.





[1] John James Audubon had four children, one of whom was John Woodhouse Audubon [1812-1862]. The younger Audubon married twice; he had two children with his first wife, Maria Bachman [1816-1840], and seven with his second wife, Caroline Hall [1811-1899].  Of the seven, five lived to adulthood, and one of them, William Bakewell Audubon [1847-1885], left the United States for Australia in either 1880 or 1882. He began a new life raising sheep near Yass, a small town about 250 miles west of Sydney. He married Lucy Ann Grovenor in 1885, and they had two children, Leonard Benjamin and Ella Caroline. According to a letter of 9 July 1952 from Ella Caroline Audubon to John Walker (in NGA curatorial files), Audubon paintings were sent to Australia in 1899 or 1900, which would correspond with the death of Caroline Hall Audubon on 1 February 1899. Miss Audubon's letter states that her father arrived in Australia 8 April 1880. However, Walter Audubon gives 21 January 1882 as the date that William Bakewell Audubon sailed for Australia, and he writes also that it was William who ""brought with him many paintings by his grandfather, John James Audubon"" (see Walter Audubon, _Last of the Audubon Line: The Descendants of John Woodhouse Audubon_, Franklin, North Carolina, 2002: 72-79).

[1] Charles Philipon, editor of _La Caricature_, having commissioned and paid Daumier to execute maquettes for a gallery of busts to be printed as lithographs, owned the clay figures outright, and they remained with his family after he died in 1862.  They were purchased in 1927 from Philipon's descendants by dealer-publisher Maurice Le Garrec, who commissioned the Barbedienne foundry in Paris to cast the full set of thirty-six figures, twelve busts at a time.  The first set was made available by subscription in 1929-1930, the second set apparently in early 1940, and the final set by around 1950.  Lessing Rosenwald purchased each of his three groups of twelve shortly after they were made available.  The Barbedienne foundry returned the orginal clays and plaster molds to Le Garrec's widow when it ceased operation in the early 1950s.  Subsequently Madame Le Garrec commissioned three full sets of the busts from another foundry, Valsuani, and the clays and molds were destroyed when this edition was completed in March 1965.

[1] Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll, _The Paintings of J.M.W. Turner_, 2 vols., 2nd rev. ed., (New Haven and London, [1977] 1984), I: no. 412, begin their provenance with Windus.

[2] The picture is not mentioned by Thomas Tudor, who visited Windus on 21 June 1847, as being among the latter's collection of Turners at that time (Butlin and Joll, as per note 1 above, I: 259).

[3] This is probably John Mountjoy Smith (1805-1869), who took over the firm when his father, John Smith (1781-by 1855), the picture dealer of 137 New Bond Street, retired in 1837. The information was kindly provided by Julia Armstrong-Totten; see her e-mail, 1 March 2011, in NGA curatorial files. (In the 1992 NGA catalogue of its British paintings, the elder Smith was incorrectly suggested as possibly being this Smith.) For more about the Smith firm, see Charles Sebag-Montefiore, with Julia I. Armstrong-Totten, _A Dynasty of Dealers: John Smith and Successors, 1801-1924: A Study of the Art Market in Nineteenth-Century London_, Arundel and London, 2013.

Rosenwald; [1] gift 1950/1951 to the National Gallery of Art. 

[1] In _Recollections of a Collector_, 1976, p. 56-57, Rosenwald described being approached by a young man in South America who offered to sell his father’s collection of prints that he had brought with him from Germany. Rosenwald gives the year as 1951, but his appointment books confirm that it was actually 1950 - he left for Buenos Aires on 9 February 1950 and returned on 20 March 1950 (Library of Congress, Rosenwald Papers, Box 75). Rosenwald writes that he bought the entire collection of some 1100 prints and drawings, but as they had already been scheduled to be sent to Europe they came to the United States via Antwerp, arriving in the US in late April 1950. Rosenwald decided to keep about a quarter of the collection, destined for the National Gallery of Art, and donate the remainder to other institutions. The inventory log of Alverthorpe indicates that just over 300 works were accessioned there in May of 1950, inventory numbers 50.260-50.530, acquired from Claude Schaefer (Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, RG 45A1, Rosenwald Papers, Box 41).",Rosenwald Collection,Print,,,0,CG-W,,,,,2023-05-09 17:01:03.48-04,Q65362578,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/1ac28e3c-485c-43a9-a325-bf5843e7b79d,"https://api.nga.gov/iiif/1ac28e3c-485c-43a9-a325-bf5843e7b79d/full/!800,800/0/default.jpg"

[1] Jonathan Sturges owned a number of Durand's studies from nature (David B. Lawall, _Asher B. Durand: A Documentary Catalogue of the Narrative and Landscape Paintings_, New York, 1978, nos. 354, 384, and 411), but this painting is not listed in ""Our Private Collections, No. II,"" _The Crayon_ 3, February 1856, 57 58, an article that discusses Sturges' paintings by Durand, nor is it mentioned in Thomas S. Cummings, _Historic Annals of the National Academy of Design (1825-1863)_, Philadelphia, 1865:  141 (reprint, New York, 1965), which records paintings by Durand in the Sturges collection, nor is it in the list of the Sturges collection in Henry T. Tuckerman, _Book of the Artists_, New York, 1867: 627 (reprint, New York, 1967); however, Frederick Sturges III was told by his father, Frederick Sturges, Jr., that all the Durands in the family collection came from Jonathan Sturges (letters dated 27 August and 7 December 1981 from Frederick Sturges III, in NGA curatorial files).  The family tradition may be inaccurate, for two letters known from Frederick Sturges -- one of 16 June 1858 to Asher B. Durand (Asher B. Durand papers, New York Public Library) and the other of 22 June 1858 to John Durand (John Durand papers, New York Public Library) --indicate that he, too, purchased paintings directly from the artist.  Nevertheless, in the absence of evidence indicating that Frederick Sturges acquired this painting, the possibility of ownership by Jonathan Sturges cannot be excluded.



[2] Frederick Sturges, Jr., died 14 October 1977 (letter of 27 January 1982 from Frederick Sturges III in NGA curatorial files); this painting came to the National Gallery as a bequest in 1978 with four other paintings (see Durand, _A Pastoral Scene_ [1978.6.3]; Casilear, _View on Lake George_ [1978.6.1]; Edmonds, _The Bashful Cousin_ [1978.6.4]; and Kensett, _Beach at Beverly_ [1978.6.5]).

[1] According to the catalogue of the 5 July 2000 Sotheby's sale (no. 148), the NGA sculpture was the one actually exhibited in London, on loan from the Italian Ministry of Public Instruction. Nicholas Penny, ""Pietro Magni and his _Reading Girl_,"" In _La Sculpture au XIXe Siècle: Mélanges pour Anne Pingeot_, Paris, 2008: 158-164, proposes that the NGA sculpture is a copy of the one exhibited, a copy that was commissioned by the London Stereoscopic Company.

[2] Diane Bilbey, with Marjorie Trusted, _British Sculpture 1470-2000_, London, 2002: 341-342. The Company lent the sculpture to the 1865 Dublin International Exhibition.		

[3] Henry Page purchased Fanhams Hall in 1859, but did not take up personal residence, and instead rented it to tenants. However, various improvements were made to the residence in the early 1870s in order that it could serve as a home for his daughter, Anne Elizabeth, and her husband, Lieutenant Richard Benyon Croft, who had married on 22 September 1869. The house technically remained the property of the Page family until 1899, when Henry Page's widow died, and his daughter inherited the estate. The Crofts occupied the house until their deaths, Lt. Croft on 28 January 1912 and his wife later the same year on 6 October.

After she inherited the property, however, Mrs. Croft had embarked on a complete rebuilding of Fanhams Hall, and during 1900 and 1901 she also redeveloped and improved the gardens surrounding the house, and likely acquired the sculpture. (See ""The Full History of Fanhams Hall"" on the following Web site: http://www.fanhamshall.co.uk/fullhistory.htm)

[4] A marked copy of the sale catalogue indicates that Lady Pearson, the last surviving Croft daughter (there were eight children), purchased the sculpture for 5 pounds. For unknown reasons, it did not leave the property.

[5] The 1950 sale was of the contents of Fanhams Hall. The Hall itself was acquired by the Westminster Bank as a residential training school for their staff.

Petiet, Paris); sold June 1956 to Lessing Julius Rosenwald, Jenkintown, Pennsylvania;[2] gift 1961 to NGA.

[1] In 1952 Maurice Gobin first introduced and discussed a group of terracotta figurines; see Maurice Gobin, _Daumier Sculpteur. 1808-1879_, Geneva, 1952.  They were cast in bronze, and Lessing Rosenwald acquired ten different bronzes from the group.  Correspondence in the Rosenwald Papers, NGA Archives, suggests that the casting project was initiated and supervised by Gobin himself simultaneously with the publication of his book, and that he also seems to have masterminded their distribution and price.  For Gobin's role, see Henri M. Petiet, letters of 27 April 1956, 16 July and 11 December 1957, to Elizabeth Mongan; and Mongan, letter of 20 December 1957, to Petiet (Rosenwald Papers, NGA Archives, Box 69 [1956], and Box 74 [1957].



[2] The dealer Henri Petiet received the bronzes as soon as they were serialized, which was in pairs, and offered most of them to Mr. Rosenwald, allegedly as they were released to the public.  The fourth pair (NGA 1961.17.1 and .2) were serialized and released after February 1956 and purchased in June 1956.

Kress Foundation, New York, as Franco-Portuguese, c. 1510;[4] gift by exchange 1952 to NGA.


[1] French and Co., New York, wrote to the Samuel H. Kress Foundation on 24 November 1948 that the sculpture was ""acquired in Portugal after the deposal of King Manuel in 1911"" (transcription of letter in NGA curatorial files). There is no mention of this provenance in the Seligmann documentation (see note 2).	

[2] Documents in the records of Jacques Seligmann & Co., held by the Archives of American Art, Washington, D.C. (boxes 54, 133, 192, 246, 287, and 298), provide information about Seligmann's acquisition and sale of the sculpture. See copies in NGA curatorial files of the consular invoices, a telegram mentioning that a client in New York had admired the sculpture, the November 1924 invoice to Kobler, his 14 November 1924 acknowledgement that he had received the sculpture, and annotated photographs. The sculpture was number 2884 in Seligmann's New York inventory. See also: Germain Seligman, _Merchants of Art: 1880-1960, Eighty Years of Professional Collecting_, New York, 1961: 87-88, pl. 28.

[3] The information about Hearst's ownership can be found in the 1941 inventory of his collection (_The William Randolph Hearst Collection: photographs and acquisition records on microfiche_, Taylor Coffman, ed., New York, 1987: fiche 203; copies in NGA curatorial files). Mary Levkoff of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art kindly brought these records to the Gallery's attention; see her letters of 30 January 2003 and 19 September 2006 in NGA curatorial files. Hearst's records indicate that he sold the sculpture on 18 April 1940 to French and Co., although the dealer's stock sheets only list their purchase as from Dr. P.P. Satterwhite in early 1945.

[4] Information on the ownership and sale by Satterwhite comes from French and Co. stock sheets and photographs, on file at the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles, California. The 1945 stock sheet (marked ""1/31/45"" under ""Date Received"") indicates the sculpture came with a pedestal that is partly visible in one of the photographs, the negative of which indicates it was taken in 1941. Libby Spatz of the Getty provided this information (see copies and her letter of 9 October 1986 in NGA curatorial files). Robert Samuels, Jr., of French and Co., recalled that the dealer apparently took the sculpture as partial payment by Satterwhite for something else and gave him a credit for it (see notes by Alison Luchs of a phone conversation on 12 December 1986, in NGA curatorial files).

The painting might have been exhibited at the Kunsthaus, Zurich, in 1929, according to Waldemar George, ""L'Art en Suisse,"" _Formes_, 1929, p. 263.

[1] Roberts' self-made wealth came from various government contracts that relied on his interests in steamers and railroads. Long a patron of the fine arts, he gathered a collection of over three hundred paintings that he opened to the public free of charge.  A number of things point to the probability that Roberts owned the NGA painting. A review of the exhibition at the Artists' Fund Society in Philadelphia early in 1864 that seems to describe the NGA painting indicates that several of the paintings would ""in a few days . . . be sent to their New York possessors,"" but unfortunately none are specified (""Art in Philadelphia,"" _The Daily Evening Bulletin_ [Philadelphia, 21 January 1864]: 8:1). Roberts certainly owned a painting with the same title by the spring of that year; number 80 in the catalogue of the 1864 _Art Exhibition at the Metropolitan Fair in Aid of the U.S. Sanitary Commission_ was ""October, 1863,"" lent by M.O. Roberts. The painting was mentioned by title in a review of the exhibition, but it was ""hung too high to be studied"" and there is no clear description given (""Exhibition of Pictures at the Sanitary Fair,"" _New-York Daily Tribune_ [16 April 1864]: 12; both newspaper articles supplied by Merl M. Moore, Jr.). The fifty-two stereograph views of the exhibition held by the New York Historical Society were reviewed (Collection Box 43, PR 065-0500), but in the views that feature paintings the works are either too small or not clear enough to be identified (memo of 23 May 2003, Charlie Brock to Franklin Kelly, NGA Dept. of American and British Paintings). The only Richards painting in the 1897 estate sale catalogue is ""October,"" with dimensions given as 23 1/2 x 28, which are very close to those of the NGA painting.

[2] According to Maurice Sérullaz, _Mémorial de l'exposition Eugène Delacroix organisée au Musée du Louvre à l'occasion du centenaire de la mort de l'artiste_, Paris, 1963, no. 532, André lent the painting to _Delacroix_, Musée du Louvre, Paris, 1878, no. 77.  The painting is still listed in André's possession in Alfred Robaut, _L'oeuvre complet de Eugène Delacroix_, Paris, 1885, no. 1448. This is probably the Edouard André whose collection, with that of his wife Nélie Jacquemart, comprises the Paris museum which bears their names.

[2] According to an annotated copy of sale catalogue in the M. Knoedler library, the painting was purchased by Durand-Ruel et Cie, Paris. If, however, this is true, it is unclear how the painting came to be included in the Dumas estate sale in 1896.

[3] Alfred Robaut, _L'oeuvre de Corot_, Paris, 1905: III:116, no. 1570, listed the Gaillard collection in the provenance.

[4] According to Wildenstein and Co. précis, dated 27 January 1960, in NGA curatorial files.

[5] Pecci-Blunt had the painting on consignment with Jacques Seligmann in 1941 but decided not to sell his collection at that time. Receipt for the return of the paintings to Pecci-Blunt dated November 19, 1941, Jacques Seligmann Papers, Archives of American Art, Box 75, folder 30.  Lent by Pecci-Blunt through Seligmann to _The Functions of Color in Painting_, Phillips Memorial Gallery, Washington, 1941. See Correspondence between Seligmann and Phillips in Jacques Seligmann Papers, Archives of American Art, Box 130, folder 5 (copies NGA curatorial files).

Rosenwald; [1] gift 1950/1951 to the National Gallery of Art. 

[1] In _Recollections of a Collector_, 1976, p. 56-57, Rosenwald described being approached by a young man in South America who offered to sell his father’s collection of prints that he had brought with him from Germany. Rosenwald gives the year as 1951, but his appointment books confirm that it was actually 1950 - he left for Buenos Aires on 9 February 1950 and returned on 20 March 1950 (Library of Congress, Rosenwald Papers, Box 75). Rosenwald writes that he bought the entire collection of some 1100 prints and drawings, but as they had already been scheduled to be sent to Europe they came to the United States via Antwerp, arriving in the US in late April 1950. Rosenwald decided to keep about a quarter of the collection, destined for the National Gallery of Art, and donate the remainder to other institutions. The inventory log of Alverthorpe indicates that just over 300 works were accessioned there in May of 1950, inventory numbers 50.260-50.530, acquired from Claude Schaefer (Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, RG 45A1, Rosenwald Papers, Box 41).",Rosenwald Collection,Drawing,,,0,CG-W,,,,,2023-05-09 17:01:03.48-04,Q64539922,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/1841f7e6-867f-45d0-b1ff-751f9b6a3c65,"https://api.nga.gov/iiif/1841f7e6-867f-45d0-b1ff-751f9b6a3c65/full/!800,800/0/default.jpg"

[1] The artist's heirs were René De Gas, his last surviving brother, who lived in Paris, and the four surviving children (of eight) of his sister Marguerite, who had died in Argentina in 1895.  (His other deceased sister Thérèse left no descendants.) Marguerite's children were: Jeanne Fevre, unmarried and acting on both her own behalf and as the representative of her sister, Madeleine Marie Pauline Fevre, a Carmelite nun; Henri Jean Auguste Marie Fevre, an industrialist who lived in Marseille; and Gabriel Edgar Eugène Fevre, an agent in Montevideo, Uruguay.  See Anne Pingeot and Frank Horvat, _Degas sculptures_, Paris, 1991, and Anne Pingeot, ""The casting of Degas' sculptures: Completing the story,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 60-63.



[2] On 13 May 1918 a contract was signed between the artist's heirs and the Hébrard foundry authorizing the reproduction of Degas' sculptures in bronze.  Of the approximately 150 statuettes found in the artist's studio after his death, 74 figures were ultimately cast in bronze.  The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.  See Sara Campbell, ""Degas' bronzes: Introduction,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 6-10.



[3] The article by Anne Pingeot referenced in note 1 provides details of the role of Hébrard's daughter in the history of the foundry, and its work in casting the bronzes.

[1] According to the archives of the Hébrard foundry, cited in Anne Pingeot, _Degas Sculptures_, Paris, 1991: no. 48 and ""Repartition des bronzes avant 1936"" on p. 196. See also Joseph S. Czestochowski and Anne Pingeot, _Degas Sculptures. Catalogue Raisonné of the Bronzes_, Memphis, 2002: 163.

[3] Czestochowski and Pingeot 2002, 141, where 1926 is assigned as the year of purchase; however, given that the Ferargil Galleries ""List of Sales, January 1926-March 20, 1936"" (their records, 1900-1963, Reel D322, frames 351-424, Archives of American Art, Washington, D.C.) spanned a ten year period, the purchase could have been made later. Although Ferargil's records list Arthur ""Block"" as the buyer, this is almost certainly Arthur Bloch, a partner in N. Snellenberg & Co. (a department store in Philadelphia and Wilmington) and wealthy collector whose interests included material related to Benjamin Franklin (see a Parke-Bernet Galleries sale of 20 October 1954 in New York).

Lytton of Chicago, and another in 1912, which had been sold to and returned by W. Jennings.  The recorded measurements of the painting sold to W.

[1] In _Recollections of a Collector_, 1976, p. 56-57, Rosenwald described being approached by a young man in South America who offered to sell his father’s collection of prints that he had brought with him from Germany. Rosenwald gives the year as 1951, but his appointment books confirm that it was actually 1950 - he left for Buenos Aires on 9 February 1950 and returned on 20 March 1950 (Library of Congress, Rosenwald Papers, Box 75). Rosenwald writes that he bought the entire collection of some 1100 prints and drawings, but as they had already been scheduled to be sent to Europe they came to the United States via Antwerp, arriving in the US in late April 1950. Rosenwald decided to keep about a quarter of the collection, destined for the National Gallery of Art, and donate the remainder to other institutions. The inventory log of Alverthorpe indicates that just over 300 works were accessioned there in May of 1950, inventory numbers 50.260-50.530, acquired from Claude Schaefer (Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, RG 45A1, Rosenwald Papers, Box 41).",Rosenwald Collection,Print,,,0,CG-W,,,,,2023-05-10 13:28:58.583-04,Q65356835,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/52abaf69-aebd-4f6a-b072-ffa897ec5603,"https://api.nga.gov/iiif/52abaf69-aebd-4f6a-b072-ffa897ec5603/full/!800,800/0/default.jpg"

Rosenwald writes that he bought the entire collection of some 1100 prints and drawings, but as they had already been scheduled to be sent to Europe they came to the United States via Antwerp, arriving in the US in late April 1950. Rosenwald decided to keep about a quarter of the collection, destined for the National Gallery of Art, and donate the remainder to other institutions. The inventory log of Alverthorpe indicates that just over 300 works were accessioned there in May of 1950, inventory numbers 50.260-50.530, acquired from Claude Schaefer (Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, RG 45A1, Rosenwald Papers, Box 41).",Rosenwald Collection,Drawing,,,0,CG-W,,,,,2023-05-09 17:01:03.48-04,Q64594044,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/8d71f1c0-232a-4702-886e-99a8b43147c5,"https://api.nga.gov/iiif/8d71f1c0-232a-4702-886e-99a8b43147c5/full/!800,800/0/default.jpg"

[1] The artist's heirs were René De Gas, his last surviving brother, who lived in Paris, and the four (of seven) surviving children of his sister Marguerite, who had died in Argentina in 1895.  (His other deceased sister Thérèse left no descendants.) Marguerite's children were: Jeanne Fevre, unmarried and acting on both her own behalf and as the representative of her sister, Madeleine Marie Pauline Fevre, a Carmelite nun; Henri Jean Auguste Marie Fevre, an industrialist who lived in Marseille; and Gabriel Edgar Eugène Fevre, an agent in Montevideo, Uruguay.  See Anne Pingeot and Frank Horvat, _Degas sculptures_, Paris, 1991, and Anne Pingeot, ""The casting of Degas' sculptures: Completing the story,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 60-63.



[2] On 13 May 1918 a contract was signed between the artist's heirs and the Hébrard foundry authorizing the reproduction of Degas' sculptures in bronze.  Of the approximately 150 statuettes found in the artist's studio after his death, 74 figures were ultimately cast in bronze.  The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.  See Sara Campbell, ""Degas' bronzes: Introduction,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 6-10.

Staples Potter, Boston; probably by inheritance to his niece, Sibyl McKenzie Snyder [1880-1954; the third wife of Robert McClure Snyder, who lived 1852-1906], Kansas City, Missouri;[2] by inheritance to her son, Kenneth W. Snyder, Kansas City, Missouri; by inheritance to Mr. and Mrs. Peter L. Chapman;[3] (sale, Sotheby's, New York, 28 May 1987, no. 81); (Berry-Hill Galleries, Inc., New York); purchased 30 October 1998 by NGA.

[1] Clarke purchased the painting from the 1887 exhibition at the National Academy of Design.



[2] Robert McClure Snyder's third wife, who he married in Boston on 1 January 1900, was the niece of H. Staples Potter, a prominent businessman in that city.  Snyder died in 1906, and his widow not until 1954. Since it is known that Potter purchased the painting at the 1899 Clarke collection sale, and that it descended in the Snyder family, it is likely the family acquired it through Sibyl McKenzie's marriage to Robert Snyder. It is not known when Sibyl acquired the painting, nor when it passed to Kenneth W. Snyder and the subsequent generations of Snyders. See the Snyder family information given to Gertrude Grace Sill, the artist's biographer, by Peter L. Chapman (sent to Alan Shestack with a letter of 23 September 2002, copy in NGA curatorial files).

Kennedy, New York; his firm, (H. Wunderlich & Co., New York [later Kennedy Galleries]); sold January 1902 to John Howard Whittemore [d. 1910], Naugatuck, Connecticut; probably bequeathed to the J. H. Whittemore Company, Naugatuck, Connecticut, with life interest to his daughter, Miss Gertrude B. Whittemore [d. 1941], Naugatuck, Connecticut;[1] gift 1943 to NGA.



[1] Andrew McLaren Young, Margaret F. MacDonald, and Robin Spencer, with the assistance of Hamish Miles, _The Paintings of James McNeil Whistler_, New Haven, 1980: 170, dates the transcation with Whittemore to 1900, based on a note by Kennedy in the New York Public Library. However, according to a letter (signed by Hermann Wunderlich) of 24 November 1934 from Kennedy & Co. to the J.H. Whittemore Company, the painting was purchased directly from the artist in May 1901 (recounted in letter of 7 April 1948 from Clarence E. Jones, Whittemore Co. treasurer, to James Lane, in NGA curatorial files).  In addition, the invoice for the sale from Wunderlich to Whittemore is dated 6 January 1902, with payment received 22 January (copy in NGA curtaorial files). The artist Edward Austin Abbey recommended the painting, as ""the property of a Mr. Whittemore of Naugatuck,"" to Isabella Stewart Gardner when it was exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in early 1902 (letter of 30 January 1902, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston, copy in NGA curatorial files). Another question in the records seems to be which ""Mr. Whittemore"" purchased the painting, John Howard Whittemore, or his son, Harris Whittemore.  Most of the records seem to point to John Howard Whittemore. The 1902 invoice was made out to ""J. H. Whittemore,"" and the loan of the painting to five exhibitions prior to John Whittemore's death in 1910 was credited to either ""John H. Whittemore"" or ""J.H. Whittemore."" Although not explicitly documented, it seems that, as with _Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl_, John Howard Whittemore's daughter, Gertrude B. Whittemore, was given a life interest in the painting after it became owned by the J.H. Whittemore Company, a company formed after John Howard Whittemore's death. Miss Whittemore is credited as the owner of the painting in the six exhibitions to which it was lent prior to her death in 1941.  Despite this evidence, letters in NGA curatorial files from the Whittemore Company always discuss the painting as having been owned by Harris Whittemore, and the 1980 catalogue raisonné (p. 170), confuses the two Whittemore names, referring to ""J. Harris Whittemore"" at one point.",Harris Whittemore Collection,Painting,,,0,CAB,,,,,2023-07-06 22:01:33.937-04,Q18154688,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/357b1f5b-2d1b-4bb1-8246-02e38b08476a,"https://api.nga.gov/iiif/357b1f5b-2d1b-4bb1-8246-02e38b08476a/full/!800,800/0/default.jpg"

See Dominique Lobstein, ""Die Ausstellung Paul Gauguin in der Galerie Barbazanges im Jahre 1919,"" in _Paul Gauguin: Vom der Bretagne nach Tahiti.

The painting is reproduced in Louise Gebhard Cann, ""Gauguin's Image of Himself,"" _International Studio_ 82 (May 1925): 120, with Hodebert in the caption, although the picture would have left Hodebert by 1923, when it was sold to Reid & Lefèvre. Hodebert was the successor to the Galerie Barbazanges, which was located on the property of fashion designer Paul Poiret. Poiret went bankrupt in the early 1920s and it is probably at that time that the gallery changed ownership/name.

Knoedler & Company, Inc., New York); purchased May 1956 by Paul Mellon, Upperville, Virginia; gift 1985 to NGA.

[1] The artist's heirs were René De Gas, his last surviving brother, who lived in Paris, and the four (of seven) surviving children of his sister Marguerite, who had died in Argentina in 1895.  (His other deceased sister Thérèse left no descendants.) Marguerite's children were: Jeanne Fevre, unmarried and acting on both her own behalf and as the representative of her sister, Madeleine Marie Pauline Fevre, a Carmelite nun; Henri Jean Auguste Marie Fevre, an industrialist who lived in Marseille; and Gabriel Edgar Eugène Fevre, an agent in Montevideo, Uruguay.  See Anne Pingeot and Frank Horvat, _Degas sculptures_, Paris, 1991, and Anne Pingeot, ""The casting of Degas' sculptures: Completing the story,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 60-63.



[2] On 13 May 1918 a contract was signed between the artist's heirs and the Hébrard foundry authorizing the reproduction of Degas' sculptures in bronze.  Of the approximately 150 statuettes found in the artist's studio after his death, 74 figures were ultimately cast in bronze.  The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.  See Sara Campbell, ""Degas' bronzes: Introduction,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 6-10.



[3] The article by Anne Pingeot referenced in note 1 provides details of the role of Hébrard's daughter in the history of the foundry, and its work in casting the bronzes.

[1] The painting is listed in the Andries Bonger list, no 264, as ""roses dans un pot (fond vert bleu) / vendu le 9 juin 1891 à M. Gallimard à fr. 400."" This list of 364 works by Van Gogh is in the handwriting of Andries Bonger, who was Theo Van Gogh's brother-in-law. The list is undated, but thought by scholars to be c. 1890/1891 (""Catalogue des oeuvres de Vincent van Gogh,"" manuscript b 3055 V/1962, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam; transcribed and published in Walter Feilchenfeldt, _Vincent van Gogh: die Gemalde 1886-1890_, Wadenswil, 2009, and Walter Feilchenfeldt, _Vincent van Gogh, the Years in France. Complete Paintings 1886-1890_, London, 2013: 287ff; copy in NGA curatorial files). The transcription of the entry for 264 in Feilchenfeldt 2013 is missing the word ""bleu"" in the first line; see the Bonger list in digitized form at http://www.geheugenvannederland.nl/en/geheugen/view?coll=ngvn&identifier=VGM01%3Ab3055 (accessed May 2018). Previously the first documented reference to Gallimard's ownership was a 1905 exhibition catalogue mentioned by J.-B. de la Faille, _The Works of Vincent van Gogh: Paintings and Drawings_, Amsterdam, 1970: no. F681. The painting is not described in Louis Vauxcelles, ""Collection M.P. Gallimard,"" _Les Arts_ (September 1908): 1-32.

[2] The painting was lent by ""Coll. B.J"" to a 1917 exhibition in Zurich, the catalogue not specifying Alexandre Bernheim (1839-1915), or his sons, Josse Bernheim-Jeune (1870-1941) or Gaston Bernheim-Jeune (1870-1953), who joined him in the art dealership.

[3] Letter dated 7 February 1929 from Reid & Lefèvre to Bernheim-Jeune (Lefèvre archives, Hyman Kreitman Research Centre, Tate Britain, London, TGA 2002/11, Box 228; copy in NGA curatorial files). The painting was exhibited at Alex Reid & Lefevre in Glasgow in 1929 as ""from a great private collection.""

Knoedler & Company, Inc., New York); purchased May 1956 by Paul Mellon, Upperville, Virginia; gift 1985 to NGA.

[1] The artist's heirs were René De Gas, his last surviving brother, who lived in Paris, and the four (of seven) surviving children of his sister Marguerite, who had died in Argentina in 1895.  (His other deceased sister Thérèse left no descendants.) Marguerite's children were: Jeanne Fevre, unmarried and acting on both her own behalf and as the representative of her sister, Madeleine Marie Pauline Fevre, a Carmelite nun; Henri Jean Auguste Marie Fevre, an industrialist who lived in Marseille; and Gabriel Edgar Eugène Fevre, an agent in Montevideo, Uruguay.  See Anne Pingeot and Frank Horvat, _Degas sculptures_, Paris, 1991, and Anne Pingeot, ""The casting of Degas' sculptures: Completing the story,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 60-63.



[2] On 13 May 1918 a contract was signed between the artist's heirs and the Hébrard foundry authorizing the reproduction of Degas' sculptures in bronze.  Of the approximately 150 statuettes found in the artist's studio after his death, 74 figures were ultimately cast in bronze.  The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.

[1] Annotated sales catalogue, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (copy in NGA curatorial files). 

[2] Gerstenberg's great-granddaughter, Julietta Scharf, kindly shared information about her family's ownership of the painting in e-mails of 20 October and 5 November 2009 (in NGA curatorial files).  Documentation from her grandmother, Margarethe Scharf, indicates that Otto Gerstenberg acquired the painting at the 1906 sale, and that Margarethe inherited the painting on her father's death. After Margarethe lent the painting to an exhibition at the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen in 1936, the director of that museum offered to store it for her during World War II.  After the war, Margarethe asked the director to arrange for it to be sold. See also Thomas W. Gaehtgens and Julietta Scharf, ""Die Sammlung Otto Gerstenberg in Berlin,"" in _Die Moderne und ihre Sammler: Französische Kunst in Deutschem Privatbesitz vom Kaiserreich zur Weimarer Republik_, Andrea Pophanken and Felix Billeter, eds., Berlin, 2001: 183. Incorrectly, M.G. Dortu, _Toulouse-Lautrec et son oeuvre_, 6 vols., New York, 1971: 2:262, does not include Gerstenberg in his provenance for the painting.

[1] The artist's heirs were René De Gas, his last surviving brother, who lived in Paris, and the four (of seven) surviving children of his sister Marguerite, who had died in Argentina in 1895.  (His other deceased sister Thérèse left no descendants.) Marguerite's children were: Jeanne Fevre, unmarried and acting on both her own behalf and as the representative of her sister, Madeleine Marie Pauline Fevre, a Carmelite nun; Henri Jean Auguste Marie Fevre, an industrialist who lived in Marseille; and Gabriel Edgar Eugène Fevre, an agent in Montevideo, Uruguay.  See Anne Pingeot and Frank Horvat, _Degas sculptures_, Paris, 1991, and Anne Pingeot, ""The casting of Degas' sculptures: Completing the story,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 60-63.



[2] On 13 May 1918 a contract was signed between the artist's heirs and the Hébrard foundry authorizing the reproduction of Degas' sculptures in bronze.  Of the approximately 150 statuettes found in the artist's studio after his death, 74 figures were ultimately cast in bronze.  The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.  See Sara Campbell, ""Degas' bronzes: Introduction,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 6-10.
